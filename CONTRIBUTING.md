# Welcome!

We’re so glad you’re thinking about contributing to a Skylight open source repository! If you’re unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is that you’ll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contribution, and don’t want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

Before contributing, we encourage you to read this project’s CONTRIBUTING policy (you’re here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

We adhere to the [Skylight Open Source Policy](https://skylight.digital/company/policies/open-source/). If you have any questions, just [shoot us an email](mailto:hello@skylight.digital).

Skylight takes seriously our responsibility to protect sensitive information, including financial and personal information, from unwarranted disclosure. For more information about security and vulnerability disclosure for this project, please read our [Skylight Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://skylight.digital/company/policies/vulnerability-disclosure/).
