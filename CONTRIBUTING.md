## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to a Skylight open source
repository! If you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the
issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is that you'll be
politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contribution,
and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

Before contributing, we encourage you to read our CONTRIBUTING policy (you are
here), our LICENSE, and our README, all of which should be in this repository.
