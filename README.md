The Skylight Website
==========================

![Jekyll Deploy](https://github.com/skylight-hq/skylight.digital/workflows/Jekyll%20Deploy/badge.svg)

This repo is for our public-facing site, which is hosted on [https://skylight.digital](https://skylight.digital).

The site is built with the [Twitter Bootstrap front-end framework](http://getbootstrap.com/) (for now), and uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static pages, which are served through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Setup
---
1. If you’re using a Mac, install homebrew (see https://brew.sh/).
2. After installing git (`brew install git`), `cd` to the directory where you want to check out the site, and then clone it (`git clone https://github.com/skylight-hq/skylight.digital.git`).
3. Install rvm (`\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`), and then install a new version of ruby (`rvm install 3.0.1`).
4. Install the `bundler` gem, then use bundler to install other project dependencies (`gem install bundler && bundle install`).
5. Install node (`brew install node -v7.10.0`), and then run `npm install` to install the local dependencies listed in `package.json`.

Running
---
1. In the directory you checked out the website into, run `jekyll serve` to start the web server.
2. Navigate to http://localhost:4000 in your browser to see your changes.
   
Testing
---
1. To execute lint tests, run the `npm run-script <script>` command in the console. Available scripts include: `scss-lint`, `html-lint`, and `js-lint`.
2. To check test for accessibility, HTML structure, and valid links, we use HTMLProofer. To run that, execute `rake test` in your local terminal.

1. Install [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
1. Install NPM `brew install node`.
1. After installing git (`brew install git`), `cd` to the directory where you want to check out the site, and then clone it (`git clone https://github.com/skylight-hq/skylight.digital.git`).
