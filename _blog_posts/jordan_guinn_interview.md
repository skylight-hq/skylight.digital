*Jordan Guinn joined Skylight in July of 2020. He's a software engineer and currently one of our tech leads. In his career, Jordan's quickly amassed a wealth of experience and leadership skills, which he brings to every project.*

**Ori Hoffer: Tell me about your path to Skylight?**

**Jordan Guinn:** I've been in tech for several years, though never previously in any governmental space. At a couple previous companies, I quickly moved from an entry-level developer to a senior software engineer and a team lead, and at that point recognized that wherever I went next, I wanted to build and deliver something meaningful and impactful to someone. Enter Skylight!

**Ori Hoffer: How did you find out about Skylight?**

**Jordan Guinn:** I was referred! I've known Adam Weber for several years, and he started working at Skylight several months before me. At some point I began looking for new opportunities, and I had known Adam to be doing meaningful work here at Skylight, so I decided to follow up and see if there might be something similar for me too!

**Ori Hoffer: Why did you decide to join?**

**Jordan Guinn:** The projects that we take on are (and specifically the project I'm currently on) important and can have a real impact on people's lived experiences in the world. That's the kind of tech work I long for, and hope to always deliver on.

**Ori Hoffer: What have you worked on so far?**

**Jordan Guinn:** Since I've started here at Skylight, I've been working on developing a [data collection tool](/work/experience/ct-ece-reporter/) for the Early Childhood Education (ECE) arm of the Connecticut Office of Early Childhood (OEC), and will continue to see that through. Additionally, we'll be adding data visualization and integration infrastructure on top of the data collected, ideally as a means to use it to improve outcomes of those children.

**Ori Hoffer: What do you see yourself accomplishing in the next six months?**

**Jordan Guinn:** Over the next six months, we'll be building out data visualization and integration infrastructure on top of our data collection tool, in order to provide OEC with a practical means of analyzing the data of the children they provide care for, and thereby improving the lives of those very children where possible.


**Ori Hoffer: Why is this work important to you?**

**Jordan Guinn:** Successful engagements here at Skylight have a positive and meaningful impact on the real lives of real people, and honestly that's all you can really ask for.

**Ori Hoffer: Jordan, thanks so much for being part of the team, we really appreciate your contributions. If you're interested in learning more from Jordan or others about Skylight, [we'd love to hear from you](/connect/contact/)**
