      <p>"Current Aircrew Eye and Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) gear poses a significant safety risk in the event of bailout and ejection via parachute. Even if the equipment is worn correctly, the straps can cover the parachute itself, preventing proper opening,

        A female pilot shared that she could not wear her parachute harness without significant pain and restriction of movement because the chest straps were cut too short by the manufacturer. A safe, short-term solution for a harness strap extender was crafted by MAJCOM gear reps while longer-term fixes are in progress.

      <p>Many aircrew, especially those with small stature, have submitted feedback in GearFit that their survival vests restrict mobility when flying, introducing significant safety concerns. Innovative pilots have contributed ideas within GearFit to make survival vests lighter, smaller, and more agile for when they're needed most.</p>

      <p>Aircrew were experiencing restricted motion wearing their life-preserver unit (LPU), which prevented them from “checking their six” (looking behind them) in a dogfight. A gear technician at another base found a solution in packing the LPU to a certain thickness around the neck, a modification that’s being added to the Technical Order (TO) to address the issue for other aircrew.</p>
