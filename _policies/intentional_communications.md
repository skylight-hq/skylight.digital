## Policy

We aspire to create an environment where employees are considerate and thoughtful in everything they do — from interacting with teammates and clients to sharing case studies with the world. One way we can all contribute to such an environment is by looking closely at the language and images we use in our speech, writing, code, and more, making sure the ideas we communicate truly reflect our intentions and stay mindful of their impact.

We expect everyone who works at Skylight, attends Skylight events and meetings, or participates in online forums or other virtual collaboration to use respectful language in their communications. As a government contractor, many of our communications are public record and can be reviewed at any time. We also comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and Executive Orders regarding workplace conduct and the content of trainings. This policy isn’t intended to supersede any such requirements.

With this in mind, we ask everyone to take the following steps to support this policy and help create an environment of consideration and thoughtfulness in every interaction:

- [Understand and replace offensive words and images](#understand-and-replace-offensive-words-and-images)
- [Accept when you've made a mistake](#accept-when-youve-made-a-mistake)
- [Speak up when you notice a violation](#speak-up-when-you-notice-exclusionary-communication)

### Understand and replace offensive words and images

Words matter. One way to be more intentional with language is to examine the words and phrases we use. Some can carry historical or societal connotations that might inadvertently alienate or marginalize people, including (but not limited to) those defined by characteristics such as religion, gender, sexual orientation, neurotype, disability, physical appearance, political belief, and others. By learning and reflecting on where these words, phrases, and images originated, we can create a space that feels welcoming to everyone.

**Skylight team members have compiled resources** that highlight potentially harmful patterns of exclusion and marginalization.

We expect that you'll remove offensive words and images from your communication patterns. We also encourage you to review existing documents, code, and other materials, replacing problematic wording with neutral or otherwise appropriate alternatives. Our goal is to foster thoughtfulness and courtesy in how we communicate — not to censor or mandate acceptance of any specific viewpoint. We believe that being mindful of impact can reduce misunderstandings and help us treat one another with respect.

This is a living document, so if you learn about additional forms of offensive language or imagery, please share with the team. If you'd like to add suggestions or rationale, you’re welcome to. The list can never be exhaustive or final, so please consider it a guide to help us be more intentional with our words.

### Accept when you've made a mistake

Using language that's welcoming to everyone can be tough. We realize this policy asks many of us to change longstanding communication habits. Even after careful effort, we might still say something that causes offense.

We reaffirm that impact often matters more than intent. When someone shares that they felt hurt by your words — even if you didn't intend to cause offense — we're asking that you acknowledge their perspective without trying to defend your intentions. A good response might be: “I'm sorry. I didn't understand or remember the impact of that word/phrase/image. Thanks for letting me know.”

Nothing in this policy requires or presupposes that anyone must feel guilt or blame solely because of their race, sex, or any other characteristic. Rather, we believe that a willingness to listen, learn, and adapt is part of respecting each other’s experiences.

### Speak up when you notice exclusionary communication

> “In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.” — Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Skylight supports a culture of respectful communication. We encourage you to speak up promptly if you witness or become aware of exclusionary or harassing language. We recognize that speaking up can be uncomfortable, but we believe this step is essential to maintaining a supportive and equitable environment.

If you perceive a violation of Skylight's Code of Conduct or this Intentional Communications Policy — regardless of the speaker's intent — we want you to feel empowered to speak up, even if the violation doesn't affect you directly.

If you’re comfortable doing so, you can say or type “Ouch” to signal that you believe the conversation needs to stop immediately. No one is required to provide additional explanation at that time, though there may be an opportunity to discuss it at the end of the meeting or in a follow-up conversation. If you're not comfortable using the “Ouch” signal or still have concerns, please reach out to Skylight’s Chief Operating Officer or any member of the leadership team. They can help address the situation or facilitate a larger conversation, if needed.

This policy is intended to align with Skylight's [Code of Conduct Policy](/company/policies/code-of-conduct/) and with all relevant federal, state, and local laws, as well as Executive Orders that may apply to our work as a government contractor.
