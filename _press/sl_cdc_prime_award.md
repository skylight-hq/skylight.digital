summary: We're honored to be awarded a $32M contract by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to use service design to determine the most impactful ways to expand SimpleReport, including how the tool can be used to collect test results across other diseases. In addition to this, we're contributing to another CDC data modernization initiative led by USDS, called Public Health Data Infrastructure, where weâ€™ll help develop a data pipeline and platform for epidemiologists to have more analysis-ready data.
