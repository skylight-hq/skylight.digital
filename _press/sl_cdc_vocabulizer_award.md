summary: We're happy to announce that we've been awarded a SBIR Phase III contract by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop an enterprise-wide software platform called Vocabulizer. The purpose of this new platform is to rationalize the CDC's disparate landscape of program-specific vocabulary tools in order to make it more efficient and effective to pass public health data between entities. We look forward to supporting the CDC in this important endeavor.
