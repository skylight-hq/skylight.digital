{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    18F Consulting was a specialized team of digital experts within the General
    Services Administration (GSA) focused on helping agencies achieve digital mastery.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    To succeed in today's public-service environment, agencies need to think and be
    digital. For most, that requires fundamental practice, culture, and technology change.
    The challenge: how do you build an organization within government whose mission is to
    help those agencies institutionalize that change?
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this challenge, Chris Cairns and Robert Read founded and
    built 18F Consulting, an intergovernmental management consulting group
    housed within the GSA.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rather than default to a change strategy of importing "Silicon Valley tech culture"
    into government, Chris and Robert recognized the unique talents and knowledge of
    institutional players &mdash; such as career civil servants and federal contractors &mdash;
    and instead brought the best of both worlds together.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the course of a year, Chris and Robert recruited, hired, led, and managed
    high-performing multidisciplinary teams &mdash; from both the public and private sectors &mdash;
    who worked hand-in-hand with numerous agencies in pursuit of digital mastery.
    These teams produced some of 18F's most notable, innovative, and transformative
    client work and reshaped how GSA delivers technology services to the rest of government.
