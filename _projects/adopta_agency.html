{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    <a href="http://adopta.agency/" target="_blank">Adopta.Agency</a> is a movement designed
    around an <a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/adopta-blueprint/" target="_blank">open blueprint process</a>
    that enables anyone to target an open government dataset, and move it forward one step by
    producing JSON, and two steps forward by launching an open API (application programming interface).

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    Following the implementation of the White House's
    <a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov/policy-memo/" target="_blank">Open Data Policy</a>,
    federal agencies produced thousands of open datasets, many of which needed
    cleaning-up and translation into a JSON format for reuse in other applications.
    Given the enormity of this undertaking, public stakeholders needed an innovative
    model for scaling the evolution of the government's open datasets.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this challenge, Kin Lane established
    <a href="http://adopta.agency/" target="_blank">Adopta.Agency</a>,
    a civic movement based upon a civic-crowdsourcing model for
    evolving the government's open data. Crowdsourcing is facilitated
    via an <a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/adopta-blueprint/" target="_blank">open blueprint process</a>
    that runs on GitHub and provides step-by-step guidance to anyone who
    wants to "adopt" and improve an open government dataset.

  </p>

  <p>
    As part of this work, Kin obtained <a href="http://kinlane.com/2016/01/22/overview-of-my-knight-funded-adoptaagency-project/" target="_blank">grant funding from the Knight Foundation to create a prototype</a>
    that focused on identifying, improving, and making datasets more accessible
    and shareable. The prototype was applied to 5 separate open
    government datasets that resulted in 5 blueprint patterns, all of
    which are available on GitHub for reuse in other open government
    dataset adoptions.
