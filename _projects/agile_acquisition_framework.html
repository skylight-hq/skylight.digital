{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The Agile Acquisition Framework is a comprehensive framework for helping government
    program teams make the paradigm shift from decades-old acquisition practices based on
    waterfall to modern acquisition practices based on agile, resulting in faster delivery of
    value, higher quality, and lower costs.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    Government program teams needed a completely new management model for
    making the leap from traditional to agile acquisition practices, but no such
    proven model existed.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this need, Chris Cairns and Robert Read, as members of 18F, pioneered
    the Agile Acquisition Framework, the government's first full-lifecycle approach
    for executing agile acquisitions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Starting with an initial version, Chris and Robert iteratively refined the
    framework through first-hand experience helping multiple acquisition programs
    adopt it successfully.
  </p>

  <p>
    The framework's design uniquely combines proven practices from multiple disciplines
    &mdash; such as user-centered design, lean startup, agile development, agile project
    management, evolutionary architecture, open source, performance-based contracting,
    and modular contracting &mdash; into a unified approach.
  </p>

  <p>
    To scale the framework's adoption across government, Chris and Robert provided
    training and coaching assistance to over a dozen professionals, who went on to
    apply it successfully to their own acquisition programs.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
  <ul>
    <li>
      Adopted by over a dozen federal and state &amp; local programs whose contracted
      efforts are consistently experiencing the full benefits of agile, including
      Treasury's Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act), Department of
      Defense's Military OneSource, Social Security Administration's Disability Claims
      Processing System, Environmental Protection Agency's Electronic Manifest System,
      Navy's Ready-2-Serve, and State of California's Child Welfare System
    </li>

    <li>
      Contributed to the avoidance of hundreds of millions of dollars in unnecessary
      technology acquisition costs
    </li>
  </ul>
