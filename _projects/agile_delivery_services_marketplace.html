{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The Agile Delivery Services Marketplace is a federal-wide, pre-vetted pool of
    software development vendors who practice agile the right way.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    Following the Healthcare.gov launch failure, federal agencies started looking
    more and more toward agile as an alternative method to waterfall for delivering
    custom software solutions. Finding a vendor who excelled at agile, however, was
    difficult. And even if agencies could find one, traditional methods of contracting
    often fell short of: (a) revealing the makers from the fakers; (b) protecting the
    government's data and source-code ownership rights to prevent vendor lock-in; and
    (c) acquiring services at the speed of need.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address these challenges, Chris Cairns, Robert Read, and other team members
    within the General Services Administration created the first-ever, federal-wide
    contract vehicle of vendors who specialize in agile delivery services (for example,
    user-centered design, agile software development, DevOps) using several groundbreaking
    approaches:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      A "show, don't tell" or "prototype-as-proposal" approach in which vendors
      were required to submit working prototypes (over written narratives)
      using <a href="https://open.fda.gov/" target="_blank">openFDA</a> as the
      basis for evaluating capabilities
    </li>

    <li>
      A <a href="https://skylight.digital/blog/public-domain-procurement/">robust contractual clause</a>
      that, by default, requires all vendors to agree to commit all data,
      source code, and documentation produced for the government to the public domain
    </li>

    <li>
      Combination of a blanket purchase agreement contract type under IT Schedule 70,
      ready-made assets (for example, solicitation templates), performance work statements,
      oral presentations, and other methods for rapidly issuing and awarding task/work orders
    </li>
  </ul>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
  <ul>
    <li>
      Attracted over 700 attendees to industry outreach events
    </li>

    <li>
      Received over 200 proposal submissions, all delivered via public GitHub repos
    </li>

    <li>
      Completed technical evaluation of all proposals within weeks by only 3 people
    </li>

    <li>
      Issued awards to 17 vendors
    </li>

    <li>
      Soundness of evaluation methodology withstood 8 protests
    </li>

    <li>
      Lauded by industry, Congress, and the White House's Office of Management and Budget
      as a model for agencies to follow
    </li>

    <li>
      Inspired several federal and state &amp; local agencies (for example,
      Department of Homeland Security, Environmental Protection Agency, State of
      California, State of Mississippi) to create a similar marketplace
    </li>

    <li>
      Used by nearly a dozen federal agencies who are experiencing improved contractual
      outcomes
    </li>
  </ul>
