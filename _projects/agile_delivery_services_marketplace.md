{% capture summary %}
The Agile Delivery Services Marketplace was a federal-wide, pre-vetted pool of
vendors who helped agencies use modern agile software development practices
to build digital services.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
Following the Healthcare.gov launch failure, federal agencies started looking
more and more toward agile as an alternative method to waterfall for delivering
digital services. Finding a vendor who excelled at agile, however, was
difficult. And even if agencies could find one, traditional methods of contracting
often fell short of: (a) revealing the makers from the fakers; (b) protecting the
government's data and source-code ownership rights to prevent vendor lock-in; and
(c) acquiring services at the speed of need.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
To address these challenges, Chris Cairns, Robert Read, and other team members
within the General Services Administration created the first-ever, federal-wide
contract vehicle of vendors who specialized in agile delivery services (for example,
user-centered design, agile software development, and DevOps) using several groundbreaking
approaches:

- A "show, don't tell" or "prototype-as-proposal" approach in which vendors
  were required to submit working prototypes (over written narratives)
  using [openFDA](https://open.fda.gov/) as the
  basis for evaluating capabilities
- A [robust contractual clause](/thoughts/blog/public-domain-procurement/)
  that, by default, requires all vendors to agree to commit all data,
  source code, and documentation produced for the government to the public domain
- Combination of a blanket purchase agreement contract type under IT Schedule 70,
  ready-made assets (for example, solicitation templates), performance work statements,
  oral presentations, and other methods for rapidly issuing and awarding task/work orders
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
- Attracted over 700 attendees to industry outreach events
- Received over 200 proposal submissions, all delivered via public GitHub repos
- Completed technical evaluation of all proposals within weeks with only three people
- Issued awards to 17 vendors
- Soundness of evaluation methodology withstood eight protests
- Lauded by industry, Congress, and the White House's Office of Management and Budget
  as a model for agencies to follow
- Inspired several federal, state, and local agencies (for example,
  Department of Homeland Security, Environmental Protection Agency, State of
  California, and State of Mississippi) to create a similar marketplace
- Used by nearly a dozen federal agencies who experienced improved contractual
  outcomes
