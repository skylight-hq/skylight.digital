{% capture summary %}
The California Health and Human Services' (CHHS) Office of Innovation
needed help putting the principles of agile into practice. We were
brought in to deliver a practical agile-coaching experience that not
only tied together all the key principles of the Agile Manifesto, but also
allowed the Office to apply these principles on a needed, real-world project.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
For some time, the CHHS Office of Innovation had been working to shift their
technical and organizational culture toward agile principles. As an
organization, the Office is responsible for lean design thinking and
delivering innovative solutions to important problems. So it was
important for the Office to not only "do" agile, but to "be" agile. However,
they were finding it difficult to connect the elements of agile
together, such as planning, testing, and iteration.

{% capture solution %}
As a partner to [CivicActions](https://civicactions.com/),
we helped lead a two-day intensive
training workshop to bring every facet of agile in a personalized,
coaching environment for the CHHS Office of Innovation. To do that,
we simulated five sprints in a microcosm within those two days,
focusing on applying the Scrum practices of planning, story writing,
story estimation, velocity calcuation, and testing on the Office of
Innovation's website, which was in need of substantial revision.
We aimed not only to provide coaching in the Scrum framework, but also
the energy to help participants ask the right questions about their
agile process. In this way, we aimed to provide both a valuable
learning experience and an improved real-world product.

  the CHHS Office of Innovation

  comfortable adjusting the process to fit their needs and culture of the Department they're helping."
