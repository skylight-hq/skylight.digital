{% capture summary %}
Carrot is an asynchronous communication application that reduces the noise of chat and
email so distributed teams can stay focused and informed with fewer interruptions.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
In the age of Slack and fast-moving chat conversations, the lack of focus
and clarity is a huge problem in the workplace. Chat apps keep everyone
connected throughout the day, yet it's more difficult for teams to stay
aligned around the big picture of what's most important. The problem is
the leadership signal is getting lost in all the noise.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
To address this problem, Sean Johnson led the product development of Carrot,
an asynchronous communication application for better team discussions.
Realized as the open source [OpenCompany](https://github.com/open-company)
platform, Carrot is designed to be as delightful and interactive as chat, but
asynchronous so people can get caught up on their own time. This enables leaders
to keep everyone focused on what matters most to build transparency, trust, and
stronger distributed teams.
