Already under financial stress, the COVID pandemic amplified the [difficulties they face](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-the-rural-health-care-landscape/): “since 2005, at least 163 rural hospitals have closed, more than 60% of them since 2012,” and a record 19 in 2020.
