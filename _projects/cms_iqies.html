{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recently undertook an initiative
    called the Internet Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (iQIES). The purpose of
    iQIES is to replace the existing legacy, desktop-based system with a modernized,
    web-based version. The current legacy system is used by healthcare providers
    (such as nursing homes) to submit quality-of-care assessment information.
    That information is then used by state agencies and CMS to evaluate and improve
    the quality of those providers. In support of this modernization effort, we engaged
    as a subcontractor to Ventera and provided critical design and technical expertise.

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    CMS' iQIES initiative is a complex, large-scale modernization effort aimed at
    replacing the existing legacy system. A major challenge with this initiative
    has been the need to maintain operational continuity while at the same time
    modernizing the user experience, the technical architecture, and the technology stack.

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    As a subcontractor to <a href="https://ventera.com/">Ventera</a>, we helped support the iQIES
    initiative in several key areas, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Provided design leadership to continually improve how user research, user
      experience design, and engineering teams engaged in the process of
      user-centered design
    </li>

    <li>
      Established a collaborative design platform aimed at constantly reinforcing the
      principles and practices of user-centered design
    </li>

    <li>
      Engineered the frontend experience of the application
    </li>
  </ul>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
  <ul>
    <li>
      Injected user-centered design principles and practices into the overall delivery
      process, without slowing down production
    </li>
  </ul>
