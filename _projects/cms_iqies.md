{% capture summary %}
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recently undertook an initiative
called the Internet Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (iQIES). The purpose of
iQIES is to replace the existing legacy, desktop-based system with a modernized,
web-based version. The current legacy system is used by healthcare providers
(such as nursing homes) to submit quality-of-care assessment information.
That information is then used by state agencies and CMS to evaluate and improve
the quality of those providers. In support of this modernization effort, we engaged
as a subcontractor to Ventera and provided critical design and technical expertise.

{% capture challenge %}
CMS' iQIES initiative is a complex, large-scale modernization effort aimed at
replacing the existing legacy system. A major challenge with this initiative
has been the need to maintain operational continuity while at the same time
modernizing the user experience, the technical architecture, and the technology stack.

{% capture solution %}
As a subcontractor to [Ventera](https://ventera.com/), we helped support the iQIES
initiative in several key areas, including:

- Provided design leadership to continually improve how user research, user
  experience design, and engineering teams engaged in the process of
  user-centered design
- Established a collaborative design platform aimed at constantly reinforcing the
  principles and practices of user-centered design
- Engineered the front-end experience of the application
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
- Injected user-centered design principles and practices into the overall delivery
  process â€” without slowing down production
