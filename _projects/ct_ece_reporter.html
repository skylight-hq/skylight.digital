{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The Connecticut Office of Early Childhood (OEC) wanted to improve their existing data
    collection systems to better understand and evaluate the impact of their work
    with young children and their families. As a first step in that effort,
    we're building a pilot data collection tool to help OEC gather data from
    early care and education providers that would ease the burden on users
    and improve data quality.

      and helping families."

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    OEC works towards a vision where all young children in the state are safe,
    healthy, learning, and thriving. They do this through early childhood
    policy development as well as critical program and service support
    for families, educators, child care providers, and communities.
    With over 70% of families with young children in the state in need
    of some form of child care, understanding the effectiveness of OEC's
    programs is critical to the well-being of Connecticut's children and families.
  </p>

  <p>
    In recognizing that accurate data is at the heart of truly understanding
    the impact of existing programs, making funding decisions and planning
    for the future, OEC decided to focus on improving their existing data
    collection tools and systems starting with the Early Childhood Information
    System (ECIS). ECIS is used by early care and education providers to gather
    and store important data about children in their care. However, it poses a
    number of usability challenges to providers including barriers around
    updating or correcting existing data, the existence of duplicate records
    and identification (ID) numbers per child, and unused reporting features
    due to inaccurate data.
  </p>

  <p>
    The challenge for us was to decrease the burden on early child care and
    education providers as they enter data into the system and to improve
    the quality and utility of ECIS data for all users.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    Together with OEC, we're piloting a data collection tool to improve the data
    collection process for early child care and education providers who currently
    use ECIS. This new tool will offer a more user-friendly interface, designed to
    consolidate providers' monthly reporting tasks and allow for more control over
    the data they enter. This pilot will also make better use of existing data to
    link and consolidate records, reducing manual entry errors and eliminating the
    need for providers to create a unique ID for each child.  With a data collection
    process that works better for early child care providers, OEC will have more
    reliable data to better evaluate outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, in an effort to get useful working software into the hands of
    users as soon as possible, the design and development of the pilot integrates
    successful agile and iterative practices described in
    the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/#play4">U.S. Digital Services Playbook</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    OEC envisions that this project will be used as a model for collecting and
    matching better data about the early development and education of every
    young child who has received funding from the state, and a starting point
    to better integrate existing data systems across other OEC programs and agencies.
