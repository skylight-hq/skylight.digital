{% capture summary %}
As part of a state-wide effort to better understand and support vulnerable
populations experiencing homelessness in Connecticut, we were asked
to gather specific research insights around families with young children
and explore opportunities to address their complex challenges.
In response, we conducted in-depth research and identified a targeted
technical solution to help improve a critical tool that's used to
connect families with housing solutions.

{% capture challenge %}
In July 2019, [Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont](https://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/News/Press-Releases/2019/07-2019/Governor-Lamont-Creates-Task-Force-on-Housing-and-Supports-for-Vulnerable-Populations)
announced a multi-agency effort to find ways to better support vulnerable
populations facing or experiencing homelessness in the state.

  content = "This task force will take a data-driven approach to seek a better understanding
  of this population, and to pilot better ways to make sure we can quickly meet
  all of a household's critical needs, stabilizing them more quickly, and achieving
  better outcomes for these Connecticut residents as well as for our publicly
  funded systems."

We were asked to support this effort by focusing on families with young children from
birth to age five, in collaboration with Governor Lamont's Task Force, the Office of Early
Childhood (OEC), and the Department of Housing.

{% capture solution %}
Better understanding the needs and challenges families face in seeking state
services was the first step in our work to scope out potential solutions.

We conducted in-depth research that included interviews with government agencies,
community partners, and families with young children experiencing homelessness.

Through this research, we found that infants are the most likely age group to experience homelessness.
Yet, families with young children experiencing homelessness are often underrepresented
in official counts due to a variety of reasons, including not being officially
counted as homeless while living with other people, having children who are too
young to be tracked in the public school system, and not interfacing with support
services that might identify homelessness. Significantly, a lack of steady and
safe child care also makes it difficult, and perhaps impossible, for families
experiencing homelessness to seek employment or access support services.

Above all, agencies and programs working with families often don't have the tools
or data systems required to collaborate or collect data on the complex, interrelated
challenges facing these families, making it difficult for state agencies to
choose interventions that best meet their needs.

From this research, we identified an opportunity to improve
the usefuless and usability of a tool called the family by-name list. This tool
is used by groups of providers that coordinate efforts to end homelessness in communities
across Connecticut. These groups are known as Coordinated Access Networks (CANs).
CANs rely on the family by-name list to identify vulnerable families to be prioritized
for housing. Improving the family by-name list would make it easier for CANs to refer
families to housing and other support services, and would also streamline data collection and
analysis for program planning.

To show how these improvements could be made, we delivered detailed recommendations
as part of our research report, as well as design and technical prototypes.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
- Conducted three months of research and discovery that produced a better
  understanding of the complex needs of families experiencing homelessness
- Using SQL, developed and delivered a prototype of an improved family by-name
  list to improve usefulness and usability
- Created a data dictionary to accompany the prototype family by-name
  list to help providers understand and align data fields
- Provided design prototypes for future user interfaces focused on better
  serving families
- Provided guidance for future family by-name list fields and data to
  be developed based on our research, including a Family Data Handbook
