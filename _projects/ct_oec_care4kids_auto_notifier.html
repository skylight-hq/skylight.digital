{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The Care 4 Kids program sponsored by the Office of Early Childhood (OEC)
    and administered by the United Way seeks to make child care affordable for
    children and their families in Connecticut. To support their efforts to improve
    the subsidy application process for children and families, we worked with OEC
    and United Way to co-design a process and system for sending text messages to
    a subset of families applying to renew their subsidy benefits. The pilot served
    to test the value of a lightweight solution to improve transparency and confidence
    in the application process, while providing insight into the broader needs of the
    program and its stakeholders.

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    Care 4 Kids is a program sponsored by OEC and run by United Way that helps
    low- to moderate-income families in the state pay for child care. To participate
    in the program, families and providers must meet specific eligibility and
    application requirements
  </p>

  <p>
    A number of factors, including a new case management system, was creating a growing
    application backlog and a high percentage of incomplete applications and ineligible
    applicants entering the system. Both families and providers who rely on Care 4 Kids
    subsidies were becoming increasingly frustrated due to the long wait times and
    lack of transparency into the process of renewing their benefits. United Way was
    open to experimenting with new ways to improve the processing time as well as
    increasing trust and confidence in the application process.
  </p>

  <p>
    After conducting user research and interviews to understand problems and needs
    more deeply, several critical issues became clear around communication and
    status updates for applicants that helped further inform our solution.

      "Mailed it in originally. They said they never received it, sent again.
      They never received it so I did everything at that point &mdash; fax and upload.
      Had to do it all over again after that...still hadn't received anything back
      from Care 4 Kids at that point."

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    Our goal was to identify solutions to user pain points that could be tested and
    refined quickly while providing the most impact to Care 4 Kids applicants
    (families and children). In this case, we aimed to make it easier for families
    to have insight into the status of their application, to increase parent
    satisfaction and improve some of the existing challenges with the backlog.
  </p>

  <p>
    To do so, we built an agile pilot to support sending application renewal status
    updates. Co-designed with OEC and United Way, the pilot was a SMS-based
    notification tool that let parents know when United Way received documents
    relevant to their Care 4 Kids application. Parents in this pilot could also
    request and receive information about application processing timelines via
    text at any time.
  </p>

  <p>
    A minimum viable product was built within four weeks, then live-tested and
    implemented as a pilot with nearly 180 participants over a three-month period.
    Phone, text, and online surveys were also conducted before, during and after the
    intervention period to collect feedback from users.

    <li>
      Agile pilot project launched to build and test SMS-based notification tool
    </li>

    <li>
      On a scale of 1 to 5 where 5 means the greatest satisfaction, surveyed pilot
      participants expressed an overall increase in average satisfaction rating
      from Care 4 Kids communication
    </li>

    <li>
      These parents also expressed a 19% increase in confidence that documents were
      being received by United Way
    </li>

    <li>
      Provided larger-scale recommendations to address areas where pilot results shed
      light on additional gaps, confusion and communications needs in the application
      submission process
