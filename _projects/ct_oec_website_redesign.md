{% capture summary %}
The Connecticut Office of Early Childhood (OEC) engaged us to transform their
web presence into a single, user-focused homepage with clear pathways for different
users to access the information and resources they need.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
A well-designed digital home is critical for providing information and services
that meet user needs and expectations. OEC had an out-of-date web presence that
made it difficult for users to access the important resources that OEC provides
to support young children and their families.

Feedback from users made it clear that the site was hard to use and frustrating
for the audiences that need it the most — childcare providers, families,
and even OEC staff. Some of the most pressing issues included outdated forms,
confusing language, and a desktop-only experience.

{% include callout.html
  type = "pullquote"
  content = "The forms online, many of them are outdated. So I don't look online."

This was a clear challenge for OEC in advancing its mission to support over 200,000 young
children across the state.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
To address this challenge, we engaged OEC in an agile, user-centered
process to support the redesign of their website. This process involved
collaborating with dozens of OEC users and stakeholders to create a solution that:

- Meets a diversity of complex user needs through extensive user research
- Makes it easier to search, navigate, and access critical information and resources
  — such as where to find high-quality childcare providers and how to become a
  licensed childcare provider — from a single, user-focused homepage
- Supports both mobile and desktop experiences
  Supports incremental releases of website content so value can start being
  realized sooner rather than later
- Can be maintained by internal staff through easy-to-use content management tools,
  [content guidelines](https://www.ctoec.org/oec-staff-website-support/style-guide/),
  and content design and management training

{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
- Incrementally delivered a newly-designed, responsive website in alignment
  with user tasks, goals, and needs
- Fully moved over to the new site in May 2020, which has
  continually received positive user feedback and attracted
  3x more daily visitors than the old site
- Enabled OEC to be one of the first agencies within the State of
  Connecticut to deliver timely, critical
  [online information related to COVID-19](https://www.ctoec.org/covid-19),
  which averaged over 2,000 page views per day during the pandemic period
