{% capture summary %}
The State of Connecticut manages multiple websites and analytics accounts, which
makes it hard to get a holistic view of their web properties. Needing a
streamlined solution, we customized an open-source tool to quickly deliver a
consolidated analytics dashboard.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
The State of Connecticut wanted to make date-driven decisions when developing new
digital resources, but accessing analytics was a cumbersome process and employees
weren't confident in the data. In the past, they'd worked with external teams
that developed solutions and then handed them off for maintenance. The team was
maintaining the solutions using some software development processes, but wasn't
sure if they were following best practices.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
Members of the Skylight team were originally instrumental in developing
[analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/),
and we knew we could reuse the
[open-source code](https://github.com/18F/analytics.usa.gov)
to develop a similar tool for the State of Connecticut. The original open-source
analytics tool wasn't developed for a Windows environment, so we used this development
project as a way to coach the State of Connecticut team on software development best practices.

Knowing that previous consultants had developed solutions that were difficult
to maintain, we decided it was critical to success for the State of Connecticut team to feel
confident maintaining the solution. To do that, we worked in tandem with their
data stakeholder to conduct user research, design the solution, and even commit some code.
By customizing open-source code and coaching the team throughout the process, we were able to make the
best use of taxpayer dollars and enable the State of Connecticut's team to maintain the solution.

Now, agencies have insight into which websites and pages are used and how
they're used, which informs future projects. Moreover, citizens of Connecticut
can view the information and use the open-source project to build other data
visualizations.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
- Delivered an analytics dashboard using customized open-source code
- Involved and enabled the department's team to develop and maintain the solutions using software development best practices
- Increased data transparency for the State of Connecticut's agencies and citizens
