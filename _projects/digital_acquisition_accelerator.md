{% capture summary %}
As part of the White House's Office of Management and Budget's Acquisition
Innovation Labs initiative, the Digital Acquisition Accelerator was a pilot training program
designed to accelerate the development of digital acquisition experts across the government.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
The modern delivery of information technology, including human-centered design,
lean-agile development, open-source software, and cloud computing, all represent
fundamentally new ways of procuring products and services from the vendor community.
But how do you induce the necessary institutional changes at the scale of government?
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
To address this challenge, Chris Cairns and Shashank Khandelwal architected and
led a "train-the-trainer" program designed to help agencies establish their own
multidisciplinary team of digital acquisition experts.

The program brought together expert trainers and coaches
from 18F, the Presidential Innovation Fellows, and the U.S. Digital Service, representing 
the first-ever such cross-organizational collaboration. These trainers worked with agencies
to assemble their teams and build up their expertise through a variety of development
techniques, including classroom training, hands-on learning (involving
real-world acquisitions), and knowledge capture and sharing.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
- Pilot program announced to all agencies via formal memo from the White House's Office of Management and Budget
- Over a dozen agencies applied to participate
- Produced first-ever, government-wide guidance on digital acquisitions ("Digital Acquisition Playbook")
{% endcapture %}
