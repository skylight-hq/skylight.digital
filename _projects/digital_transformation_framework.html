{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The Digital Transformation Framework is a comprehensive framework designed
    to help agencies transform into digitally-powered organizations.
  </p>

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    To think and be more digital, government organizations need to mature along
    multiple, self-reinforcing dimensions &mdash; talent and empowerment, customer experience,
    digital procurement, cloud and DevOps, data management, enterprise agile, and legacy
    modernization. But how do they do so in a way that is manageable, sustainable,
    incrementally valuable, and ultimately independent of expensive consultancies?
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this challenge, Chris Cairns, as a member of 18F and the Federal Chief Information Officer's
    Technology Transformation Task Force, the precursor to the American Technology Council,
    collaborated with multiple government technology executives and renowned transformation
    experts to develop a comprehensive framework for digital transformation. The framework
    incorporates lessons learned and best practices from multiple agencies with digital
    transformation experience, making it designed specifically to address the unique digital
    maturity needs of government organizations.
