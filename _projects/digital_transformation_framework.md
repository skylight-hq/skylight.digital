{% capture summary %}
The Digital Transformation Framework is a comprehensive framework designed
to help agencies transform into digitally-powered organizations.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
To think and be more digital, government organizations need to mature along
multiple, self-reinforcing dimensions â€” talent and empowerment, customer experience,
digital procurement, cloud and DevOps, data management, enterprise agile, and legacy
modernization. But how can they do so in a way that's manageable, sustainable,
incrementally valuable, and ultimately independent of expensive consultancies?
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
To address this challenge, Chris Cairns and Shashank Khandelwal, as members of 18F and
the Federal Chief Information Officer's Technology Transformation Task Force (the precursor
to the American Technology Council), collaborated with multiple government technology executives
and renowned transformation experts to develop a comprehensive framework for digital transformation. The framework
incorporates lessons learned and best practices from multiple agencies with digital
transformation experience, making it specifically designed to address the unique digital
maturity needs of government organizations.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
- Validated through feedback from nearly a dozen government technology executives
- Adopted by multiple federal agencies as part of comprehensive engagements with 18F
