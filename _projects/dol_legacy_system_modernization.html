{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) at the Department of Labor (DOL) has been
    relying on an aging system, called Wage Hour Investigative Support
    and Reporting Database (WHISARD), to support its labor law enforcement activities.
    The entire system needs modernized, which includes replacing the existing
    desktop-only user interface (UI) with a new web-based UI. By careful inspection
    of the code and experimentation, we created a deep "spike" solution that allows a small
    fraction of the system to be implemented with a web-based system using in-situ business
    rules and stored procedures. This spike served as a basis for planning the entire
    rewrite of WHISARD, thus de-risking the whole project.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    The existing technology behind WHISARD was ancient and nearly undocumented. In order to
    have a functioning spike, a complete and valid environment would have to be duplicated.
    Because the data was sensitive and potentially subject to litigation, we'd have
    to work entirely with artificially-created data.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    After setting up a DB2 instance with artifical data and extensive study
    of the stored procedures, we were able to interface to the database with a
    simple Python program that implemented a web service interface. This allowed
    a simple but possibility-expanding, browser-based demo.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
  <p>
    The spike solution dramatically reshaped the DOL's acquisition plan, including
    cost estimates, by proving that an API-encapsulation approach could work and be
    expanded at minimal risk.
