{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    EnergyOS is an open-source standard and developer community
    focused on advancing the interoperable exchange of energy usage data.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    Advancement of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_grid" target="_blank">Smart Grid</a> is predicated on the ability
    to share information between a large ecosystem of vendors, utilities,
    and consumers. However, no standard existed that defined how to
    involve consumers in this flow of information.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this critical gap, John Teeter and a community
    of open-source developers undertook a multi-year effort
    to implement a standard for sharing energy usage information
    between vendors, utilities, and consumers in an interoperable way.
    Called EnergyOS, this standard is based upon the
    <a href="http://www.greenbuttondata.org/" target="_blank">Green Button data standard</a>,
    which John developed while serving as a Presidential Innovation Fellow,
    and the Energy Services Provider Interface (ESPI) data standard.
  </p>

  <p>
    As part of the EnergyOS team, John provides ongoing open-source development
    of the standard, as well as other types of support, including outreach,
    deployment, testing, and implementation certification.
  </p>

{% capture results %}
  <p>Thus far, notable results include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Adopted for use in several commercial Smart Grid deployments
    </li>

    <li>
      Became the "gold standard" for all major U.S. utility companies implementing the ESPI standard
    </li>

    <li>
      Certified as an international standard
    </li>
  </ul>
