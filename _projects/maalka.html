{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    Maalka is a mixed-source, digital platform designed to enable
    energy resource managers such as building owners and local governments
    achieve efficient and sustainable utilization of energy resources.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    Energy resource managers need to manage toward specific energy-consumption goals,
    but lack the tools for tracking progress in meeting those goals and leveraging
    information to further optimize energy usage.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this challenge, John Teeter and the Maalka team developed
    a mixed-sourced (combination of open-source and proprietary technologies),
    sustainability-as-a-service platform. The platform features
    automated data ingestion of both custom and standardized representations; a
    modularized, extensible architecture to support a variety of sustainability
    initiatives flexibly; and a standards-based architecture leveraging the U.S.
    Department of Energy's Building Energy Data Exchange Standard and Standard
    Energy Efficiency Data Platform to maximize reuse and interoperability.
  </p>

{% capture results %}
  <ul>
    <li>
      Adopted by a number of customers in support of their initiatives at city,
      state, and national levels
    </li>

    <li>
      Attracted an ecosystem of collaborators who are extending the platform's
      core services through open-source components and analytics
      (for example, <a href="https://github.com/Maalka/Benchmark" target="_blank">benchmark</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/Maalka/squants" target="_blank">squants</a>)
    </li>

    <li>
      Received "best application" award at the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s
      Better Buildings Summit
    </li>

    <li>
      Selected into Wells Fargo's Innovation Incubator program,
      which is co-administered by the U.S. Department of Energy National
      Renewable Energy Laboratory
    </li>
  </ul>
