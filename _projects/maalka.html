{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    Maalka is a mixed-source, digital platform designed to enable
    energy resource managers such as building owners and local governments
    achieve efficient and sustainable utilization of energy resources.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    Energy resource managers need to manage toward specific energy-consumption goals,
    but lack the tools for tracking progress in meeting those goals and leveraging
    information to further optimize energy usage.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this challenge, John Teeter and the Maalka team developed
    a mixed-sourced (combination of open-source and proprietary technologies),
    sustainability-as-a-service platform. The platform features
    automated data ingestion of both custom and standardized representations; a
    modularized, extensible architecture to support a variety of sustainability
    initiatives flexibly; and a standards-based architecture leveraging the U.S.
    Department of Energy's Building Energy Data Exchange Standard and Standard
    Energy Efficiency Data Platform to maximize reuse and interoperability.
  </p>
