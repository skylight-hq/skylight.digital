{% capture summary %}
If the new Biden Administration wanted to admit more refugees into the country
and strengthen the program overall, they needed concrete recommendations on
how to improve the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) and advance U.S.
leadership in refugee protection around the world. Following user experience
(UX) principles, we centered refugee voices in the project.

Refugee admissions under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program reached historic
lows from 2016–2020. Over that period, programs that support refugees
resettling in the U.S. were largely dismantled.

Drastic improvements to the overall refugee experience were needed to scale
and strengthen USRAP. Overseas, refugees can wait years in refugee camps
before entering USRAP. The living conditions are very difficult, can be
dangerous, offer few opportunities to work, and supply limited access to
medical care. While waiting to move forward in the process, refugees have very
little information on the progress of their case. Their lives are in limbo for
years, before being sent across the globe with a few weeks notice.

Refugees also face significant challenges when they arrive in the U.S. Unless
they have a friend or family member in the U.S., they have no say in where
they're resettled. They receive minimal government support through
resettlement agencies and, in most cases, have to fend for themselves a few
months after relocating to the U.S. Other barriers — like culture shock,
access to transportation and education, and medical and mental health issues
— make navigating resettlement particularly difficult. As one
interviewee who spoke perfect English and worked with the U.S. military in
Iraq put it when she resettled here in 2013:
<b>"What was challenging when I first arrived? Everything."</b>

In addition, many policymakers, and even some who work with refugees, don't
understand the full scope of the process to get to the U.S.

{% capture solution %}
To help USRAP prepare to admit 125,000 refugees in FY2022 (up from 15,000 in
2020), our team, led by Ariana Berengaut, Director of the
<a href="https://global.upenn.edu/penn-biden-center">Penn Biden Center</a> and
Eric Hysen, senior fellow at the
<a href="https://ncoc.org/">National Conference on Citizenship</a>, took a
human-centered-design approach to formulating our recommendations. In dozens
of video calls, we talked to experts responsible for shaping policy,
implementing operations, or advocating for USRAP. We met with refugees who
experienced the admissions process. Using trauma-informed interviewing
techniques, we asked them to recount their experience so we might glean
critical information on what would make the process easier for incoming
refugees. We also reviewed publicly-available data to identify refugee
populations, analyze processing barriers, and model the impact of proposed
recommendations.

This approach took into account the needs, challenges, and opportunities of
refugees and their families.

Out of this research, we created action plans with concrete 100-day, 1-year,
and 2–4 year strategies for moving those plans forward.

To improve refugee outcomes, for instance, we recommended that USRAP:

- Make greater use of virtual interviews for follow-up interviews and for
  hard-to-reach refugee populations
- Prioritize the finalization of security checks for thousands of refugees
  who, after being interviewed, have been stuck in the pipeline for years
- Develop a refugee-informed algorithmic approach to determine where refugees
  are resettled in the U.S.
- Increase the scale and scope of resettlement support
- Include a broader set of interventions, such as guaranteeing six months of
  housing support to all refugees rather than tying it to employability or
  health conditions
- Allowing flexibility in funding to resettlement agencies and states to
  address diverse refugee needs

Many times, policymakers only work on one aspect of the admissions process and
lack an in-depth or nuanced view of other parts of the program. We made a
journey map illustrating all steps and pain points along the way from the
perspective of a refugee, something one person who'd worked on policy for
years said they'd never seen before.

{% capture results %}
- Completed over 100 interviews with experts and stakeholders involved in
  shaping policy, implementing operations, or advocating for USRAP, as well as
  refugees who went through the process
- Helped write a <a href="https://global.upenn.edu/penn-biden-center/refugee-admissions-project">50-page report</a> and <a href="https://global.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/penn-biden-center/Restoring%20U.S.%20Global%20Leadership%20on%20Refugee%20Protection.pdf">complementary paper</a>
- Created a journey map of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program from the
  perspective of a refugee
- Two project leads were hired into the Biden Administration: (Eric Hysen as
  Chief Information Officer at DHS and Ariana Berengaut as Senior Advisor to
  National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan), giving the recommendations more
  hope of implementation
