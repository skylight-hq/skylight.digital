{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    People Power is an Internet of Things (IoT) solution platform
    that enables the automated acquisition of sensor data from connected
    devices and the delivery of intelligent services to residential and
    commercial customers.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    IoT sensors produce overwhelming streams of data, making the
    task of understanding and responding to the information available
    for analysis within these streams extremely difficult, particularly
    for residential and commercial applications.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this difficulty, John Teeter led the engineering team to
    create an IoT platform that enables the integration of real-time data
    streams into a cloud-based repository where module automation, or "Bots,"
    are watching and responding to patterns within these data streams. The platform
    also provides domain-specific workflows for home security, wellness management,
    and social interactions.
