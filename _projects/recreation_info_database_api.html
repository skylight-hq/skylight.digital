{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    When the Recreation Information Database (RIDB) contract came up for rebid,
    the request for proposal (RFP) had insufficient language regarding an application
    programming interface (API). Without the right language, the government risked
    procuring a solution that would leave the existing website as the only source for
    browsing national park information from the database, thus limiting the potential
    for mobile and other forward-thinking types of applications.

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    The Department of Agriculture's RIDB RFP was going to close in two weeks.
    To align this effort with its <a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov/policy-memo/"
    target="_blank">Open Data Policy</a>, the White House sought urgent
    advice on how to make the RFP more API focused so that the next generation of
    Recreation.gov could not only serve mobile users, but also foster future innovation
    via an external API developer community.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    Working as an API evangelist, Kin Lane answered the White House's
    call-to-civic-action by <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/16/i-need-help-to-make-sure-the-dept-of-agriculture-leads-with-apis-in-their-parks-and-recreation-rfp/" target="_blank">proposing critical language changes to the RIDB RFP</a>
    to ensure that vendor proposals reflected an API-based solution approach
    using modern practices such as RESTful API design, supporting documentation,
    and software development kits (SDKs).
  </p>

  <p>
    Following the rework and release of the RFP, Kin engaged even further in
    helping to make the RIDB API initiative a success by building a user and
    developer community around the API, as well as collaborating with industry
    and government to explore <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/24/setting-a-precedent-when-charging-for-high-volume-access-to-government-apis/" target="_blank">innovative economic models for monetizing access to national park data</a>.
