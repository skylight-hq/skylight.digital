{% capture summary %}
To further their mission of helping small businesses succeed, the Small
Business Administration (SBA) needed a learning platform focused on
female entrepreneurs. As a subcontractor to Fearless, we were brought in to
deliver a technical solution that maximizes the use of an existing
open-source-software product without limiting the flexibility needed
to deliver a unique user experience.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
Female entrepreneurs start and own nearly half of all businesses in the U.S.,
employ 9.4 million workers, generate $1.9 trillion in revenue, and represent
all industries. To help elevate their success, the SBA launched Ascent, a free
online learning platform based on an existing open-source content management system
(CMS) called Brightspot. A critical challenge was leveraging Brightspot in such a way as
to not only avoid constraining the design of the user experience to what's available
"out-of-the-box," but also to avoid the nightmare of having to maintain a
"custom-off-the-shelf-software" product.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
As a subcontractor to [Fearless](https://fearless.tech/), our team provided
additional technical leadership around how best to address this challenge.
In particular, we helped architect and engineer a custom API wrapper that
programmatically makes calls into Brightspot, thereby leveraging its full feature set in
an independent way. This approach gave them the power to create a curated learning
experience for female entrepreneurs.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
- Demonstrated via a spike solution that a customized API would not only work
with Brightspot, but would also provide a robust front-end development
resource for the SBA
- Delivered 11 modules of working content, including video, audio, downloadable
worksheets, interactive self-assessments, and more
- Released to the public in January 2021
