{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The team launched a minimum viable product (MVP), helping the United States Space 
    Force (USSF) disseminate information. Servicemembers can use the portal to access 
    resources like internal training opportunities, human resource documents, and announcements.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    USSF lacked a central place to share announcements, resources, and other important 
    information with servicemembers (Guardians), instead relying on easily missed emails 
    or newsletters to disseminate information.    

    It wasnâ€™t always clear where to get help when trying to answer a question about medical 
    benefits, find career training opportunities, or access other important human resources information.  

    Space Force needed a streamlined way to share information with teams and the broader organization, 
    and so we needed to get to an MVP quickly. Before we could build excitement and trust in a 
    more extensive portal, our immediate goal was to quickly launch a landing page.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    In partnership with USSF stakeholders, we launched an MVP portal in two months.  

    We used lightweight design tools to quickly prototype page layouts for the microsite, 
    with best practice design patterns from the U.S. Web Design System 

    Rather than cluttering the portal with links, the team worked with USSF to identify 
    the highest priority content needs. We started with announcements, human resources 
    information, and career opportunities.
