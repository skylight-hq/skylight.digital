{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The Social Security Administration (SSA) needed help turning around
    a failing case management system modernization program, which included
    a staff of over 200 government and contractor personnel. We were brought
    in to provide advice on transitioning their software delivery practices
    from waterfall to agile, contributing to the start of a successful turnaround.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    The SSA's case management system modernization program was
    suffering from the ill-effects of a waterfall-based software
    development approach, including the dysfunctional separation of
    users from the development team.
  </p>

  <p>
    With oversight bodies coming down more and more heavily on the program,
    the SSA needed to make immediate course corrections. Leadership decided
    to explore the idea of phasing in the adoption of agile, but the program
    team had no prior experience with this new and more effective way of delivering
    software.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To demonstrate the power of agile and how it could be applied within the
    context of the SSA's troubled program, we designed and facilitated an
    extensive, hands-on workshop using formal agile practices based on the
    Scrum framework.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the course of 6 formal sprints packed into 3 days, we guided a small
    subset of the SSA program team through a collaborative process of writing
    user stories, prioritizing and grooming a product backlog, implementing the
    prioritized user stories in the system's development environment, and
    experiencing other standard Scrum ceremonies such as sprint reviews and
    retrospectives.
