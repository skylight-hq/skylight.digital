{% capture summary %}
The Social Security Administration (SSA) needed help turning around
a failing case management system modernization program, called
Disability Case Processing System (DCPS), which included a staff of
over 200 government and contractor personnel. We were brought
in to provide advice on transitioning their software delivery practices
from waterfall to agile, contributing to the start of a successful turnaround.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
The SSA's DCPS program was suffering from the ill-effects of a waterfall-based
software development approach, including the dysfunctional separation of
users from the development team.

With oversight bodies coming down more and more heavily on the DCPS program,
the SSA needed to make immediate course corrections. Leadership decided
to explore the idea of phasing in the adoption of agile, but the program
team had no prior experience with this new and more effective way of delivering
software.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
To demonstrate the power of agile and how it could be applied within the
context of the SSA's troubled DCPS program, we designed and facilitated an
extensive, hands-on workshop using formal agile practices based on the
Scrum framework.

Over the course of six formal sprints packed into three days ("micro-sprints"), we
guided a small subset of the DCPS program team through a collaborative process of
writing user stories, prioritizing and grooming a product backlog, implementing
the prioritized user stories in the system's development environment, and
experiencing other standard Scrum ceremonies such as sprint reviews and
retrospectives.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
- Brought together users and developers into the room for the first time
- Within just three days of work, produced an astounding improvement to the
usability of the system, as expressed by representative users
- Gave leadership practical insight into the transformative nature of
agile, inspiring a decision to accelerate its adoption that has led to
a promising turnaround
