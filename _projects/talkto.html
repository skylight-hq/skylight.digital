{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    TalkTo was a popular digital messaging service that let consumers
    text any business &mdash; such as a local grocery store or
    government office &mdash; using their mobile or desktop device, and
    receive a response within minutes.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    People find traditional ways of communicating with businesses
    (such as via telephone) annoying and inefficient.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    Given the rise and convenience of text messaging, Sean Johnson and the TalkTo
    team created web and native mobile versions of an application that lets consumers
    text any business at all, even those that have never heard of TalkTo, and receive
    a response within five minutes. Speed and reliability were critical aspects of the
    user experience so Erlang, which is known for its ability to support massively
    scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability, was chosen
    as the backend.
