{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Chief Information Officer (CIO)
    needed help undertaking a broad cloud transformation initiative, so a specialized
    team of site reliability engineers was provided to jumpstart the transition.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    The TSA's CIO organization faced several issues associated with running its on-premise
    IT infrastructure (such as high operating costs), which were going to be further
    compounded by imminent budget cuts. The cloud presented a way out, but the organization
    lacked in-depth experience operating in this new way.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this challenge, Chris Cairns and Shashank Khandelwal, as a members of 18F, designed an approach to
    kickstart the organization's adoption of a cloud-based operating model. This involved
    pairing TSA with an expert team of site reliability engineers who:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Introduced an agile-based approach to migrating the portfolio of applications
      over a series of phases
    </li>

    <li>
      Migrated two low-risk applications within a few months to give leadership immediate
      insight into what changes needed to be made to the organization's structure, culture,
      talent mix, practices, tooling, and vendor ecosystem
    </li>

    <li>
      Showcased the value of combining cloud services with DevSecOps practices such as
      infrastructure as code
    </li>

    <li>
      Imparted cloud and DevOps competencies through training, coaching, and hiring support
    </li>
  </ul>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
  <ul>
    <li>
      Jumpstarted movement to the cloud, which is projected to save tens of
      millions of dollars to meet impending budget reductions
    </li>

    <li>
      Inspired shift toward modern practices such as lean-agile and DevOps
    </li>
  </ul>
