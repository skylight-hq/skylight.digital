{% capture summary %}
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Chief Information Officer (CIO)
needed help undertaking a broad cloud transformation initiative, so we provided a specialized
team of site reliability engineers to jumpstart the transition.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
The TSA's CIO organization faced several issues associated with running its on-premise
IT infrastructure (such as high operating costs), which were going to be further
compounded by imminent budget cuts. The cloud presented a way out, but the organization
lacked in-depth experience operating in this new way.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
To address this challenge, Chris Cairns and Shashank Khandelwal, as members of 18F, designed an approach to
kickstart the organization's adoption of a cloud-based operating model. This involved
pairing TSA with an expert team of site reliability engineers who:

- Introduced an agile-based approach to migrating the portfolio of applications
over a series of phases
- Migrated two low-risk applications within a few months to give leadership immediate
insight into what changes needed to be made to the organization's structure, culture,
talent mix, practices, tooling, and vendor ecosystem
- Showcased the value of combining cloud services with DevSecOps practices, such as
infrastructure as code
- Imparted cloud and DevOps competencies through training, coaching, and hiring support
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
- Jumpstarted movement to the cloud, which is projected to save tens of
millions of dollars to meet impending budget reductions
- Inspired shift toward modern practices such as lean-agile and DevOps
