{% capture summary %}
The United Nations' (UN) 2019 Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction conference
website didn't meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 and
needed to meet standards for visitors with disabilities. We were brought in
to audit the website and fix the accessibility issues so it met globally-accepted
standards.

{% capture challenge %}
With their conference just weeks away, the UN's technology team knew
the 2019 Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction website didn't meet the
WCAG 2.0 accessibility standards. To meet the standards and the UN Office for
Disaster Risk Reduction's commitment to accessibility, the technology team needed
to act fast.

{% capture solution %}
Leveraging [Skylight's Accessibility Guide](/work/toolkits/accessibility-guide/),
we kicked off the project with a compliance audit of the conference website's accessibility deficiencies
and generated a report of pressing issues. The audit included a review of images,
colors, contrast ratios, outlines, and other content. Working with the internal team,
we fixed the underlying issues and rewrote code to make the website meet the WCAG 2.0
accessibility standards. Finally, we tested the website with persons with
disabilities who use screen readers and keyboard inputs. The work was
completed in two weeks to meet the conference deadline.

{% capture results %}
- Completed the accessibility audit and fixes in two weeks, just in time for
the conference
- Provided accessibility development guidelines to enable future self-management
