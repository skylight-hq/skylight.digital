{% capture summary %}
To introduce the Navy Reserve's Ready-2-Serve (R2S) project team to modern
development practices and technologies, we implemented a mobile website
in a single afternoon that simulated the functionality of what was really needed.
This enabled critical design and technology decisions to be made rapidly.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
The Navy Reserve had a critical need to improve the digital experience of
sailors writing orders for their reserve duties. Making this functionality accessible
via mobile devices was a critical requirement, but whether to do this via native
mobile apps or responsive web design remained an open question.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
Using a technique that we pioneered, called "[protosketching](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/01/06/protosketch/),"
we broke the afternoon into three sprints of one hour each. In this space of time, we were
able to quickly write user stories that were acted upon by our programmers in the
protosketching session to complete a functional mock-up in three hours. This allowed the
Navy to make informed decisions on the mobile product strategy for R2S.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
- Major project decisions were de-risked at relatively low cost
