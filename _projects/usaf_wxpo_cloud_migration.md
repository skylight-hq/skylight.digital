The U.S. Air Force (USAF) Weather Systems Program Office (WxPO) faced significant roadblocks in its cloud migration efforts. Our team at Skylight helped unblock and accelerate their progress through a comprehensive service design approach, identifying and prioritizing key areas for improvement and creating the conditions for sustainable success.

{% capture challenge %}
The Department of Defense (DoD) relies on WxPO to deliver critical terrestrial and space weather intelligence. Meteorologists, air traffic controllers, pilots, and intelligence professionals use WxPO’s applications to predict weather patterns, prepare forecasts, and communicate essential weather information. These tools operate 24/7, supporting mission planning and execution.

However, WxPO’s legacy environment — comprising aging, on-premise systems—presented significant challenges. These systems weren’t designed to accommodate today’s diverse user base or leverage modern tools and processes. As a result:
- Teams struggled to deploy updates quickly and efficiently
- The aging infrastructure limited scalability, resilience, and operational efficiency
- The lack of integration across systems increased manual workloads and reduced data accessibility for users

To overcome these challenges, WxPO launched an initiative to migrate its infrastructure and applications from this legacy environment to the cloud. The move promised to modernize operations, improve access, and streamline workflows for end users.

However, the migration effort faced significant hurdles:
- Balancing the maintenance of legacy systems with the planning and execution of cloud migrations created bottlenecks.
- A lack of a clear vision or coordinated plan led to miscommunication, rework, and frustration.
- Teams were overwhelmed by learning new technologies without sufficient guidance, creating a sense of constant uncertainty.

Limited engagement with end users added to these challenges. WxPO’s legacy applications were built without a clear understanding of the diverse goals, roles, and workflows of their users, leading to gaps in functionality and usability.

Faced with these challenges, WxPO partnered with our team to reinvigorate their cloud migration efforts. Leveraging our [Service Design Accelerator program](/work/experience/usaf-service-design-capacity-building/), we collaborated with WxPO to identify root issues, align teams, and establish priorities to move their migration forward.

{% capture solution %}
Our [Service Design Accelerator](/work/toolkits/service-design-framework/) provided a structured approach to addressing WxPO’s challenges and creating momentum in their cloud migration efforts.

We began by:
- Establishing a shared vision and strategy to align teams, improve cross-team collaboration, and develop cohesive processes that reduced miscommunication.
- Enhancing the developer experience by introducing modern tools, fostering increased autonomy, and facilitating smoother workflows.
- Applying service design techniques to holistically analyze WxPO’s cloud migration challenges, identify root issues, and craft targeted solutions across key operational areas.

These foundational efforts led to critical insights into WxPO’s challenges, resulting in the identification and prioritization of eight key areas for improvement. These areas shaped our work for the remainder of the project, as we collaborated with WxPO to address immediate challenges and implement improvements:
1. Create self-service artifacts
2. Build a shared migration vision and plan
3. Provide updated training materials
4. Improve agile processes
5. Standardize and define roles
6. Establish a uniform communication strategy
8. Continue discovery efforts to identify emerging needs
9. Enhance support services

Our team worked alongside WxPO to address these areas while equipping their teams with the tools, processes, and knowledge needed to sustain progress and advance improvements.

By embedding with WxPO teams, we fostered the conditions necessary for a successful transition from legacy practices to a modern digital platform. This revitalized WxPO’s efforts, enabling them to confidently drive progress and better support the DoD weather community’s needs.

{% capture results %}
- Delivered comprehensive tools and resources, including a human-centered design playbook, service blueprints, persona templates, user research plans, an assumptions tracker, and an outcome-oriented roadmap, empowering WxPO to advance their cloud migration efforts effectively
- Conducted targeted trainings and embedded with application teams to streamline processes, improve workflows, and accelerate migration activities, fostering stronger alignment and reducing operational friction
- Developed a sustainable framework for delivering modernized, user-centered solutions, setting the foundation for WxPO’s success in meeting mission-critical needs and supporting the DoD weather community
