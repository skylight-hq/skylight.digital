{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' (USCIS') E-Verify system is
    used by employers to confirm the eligibility of their employees to work
    in the U.S. As part USCIS' efforts to modernize E-Verify, we engaged as a
    subcontractor to Excella and provided API design and technical expertise
    that contributed to the successful relaunch of the system, despite the
    complexity of the existing legacy environment.
  </p>

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    Several years ago, USCIS undertook a massive initiative to modernize their
    E-Verify system in order to improve the overall user experience. A major
    challenge with this modernization has been the need to maintain and
    integrate with a myriad of legacy systems, while simultaneously
    building out and optimizing the new system.
  </p>

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    As a subcontractor to <a href="https://www.excella.com/">Excella</a>, we helped address both the modernization
    and relaunch efforts, as well as legacy integration and modernization,
    using modern delivery practices and technologies. Some of our major
    contributions included:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Replacing existing services with new frameworks written
      in modern languages and deployed to the cloud
    </li>

    <li>
      Enhancing the efficiency of the system's query and information
      usage by rewriting the data-retrieval code in the object-relational mapping layer
    </li>

    <li>
      Improving performance of the case data ingestion pipeline by
      reconfiguring the underlying architecture of the system's data
      loading process, as well as upgrading the clustering hardware
      responsible for managing the loading
    </li>

    <li>
      Creating an API-based microservice in order to simulate the behavior
      of a Social Security Administration system, which was needed for
      third-party API integration testing
    </li>
  </ul>

{% capture results %}
  <ul>
    <li>
      Helped relaunch E-Verify in April of 2018
    </li>

    <li>
      Migrated 225 million historical cases into the Elasticsearch
      datastore for efficient, fast-searching capability
    </li>

    <li>
      Improved the speed of verification for over 800,000 enrolled employers
    </li>
  </ul>
