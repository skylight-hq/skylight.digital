{% capture summary %}
The Veterans Affairs' (VA) API Platform Management team wanted to increase
adoption of their APIs. We developed a comprehensive research report
on how the VA can accomplish that goal, based on a combination of our own expertise and
information gathered from interviewing leading organizations.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
Recognizing that simply making datasets and APIs available doesn't guarantee
success, the VA wanted to expand the adoption of their APIs. They needed
insight into how to build and sustain an effective developer outreach program.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
To address this challenge, we conducted a research process that involved:

- Mining information related to API developer outreach from our decade's worth of
existing primary and secondary research, which amounts to over 3,000 API-related articles
- Augmenting this research by interviewing key people responsible for API developer
outreach at a diverse number of public- and private-sector organizations
- Analyzing and synthesizing our research information into a comprehensive report on
API developer outreach best practices, covering topic areas such as funnel metrics
and developer sandbox environments
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
- Delivered the project under the federal procurement micropurchase threshold of $10,000
- Interviewed seven different organizations, including the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services' Blue Button API program, the Census Bureau,
OpenFEC, and more
- Published the report in the open and with no copyright, making it free to anyone
who wants to learn from and reuse the content
