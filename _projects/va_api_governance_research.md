{% capture summary %}
The Veterans Affairs' (VA) API Platform Management team needed insight
into current best practices for API governance. So we built them a
comprehensive research report that drew on a combination of our own
expertise and information gathered from interviewing
leading organizations.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
In preparation for gearing up the number of APIs delivered across the
enterprise, the VA's API Platform Management team needed to better
understand best practices for governing APIs, particularly given the
lack of formal research in this area.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
To address this challenge, we conducted a research process that involved:

- Mining information related to API governance from our decade's worth of
existing primary and secondary research, which amounts to over 3,000
API-related articles
- Augmenting this research by interviewing key people responsible for
API governance at a diverse number of public- and private-sector organizations
- Analyzing and synthesizing our research information into a comprehensive
report on API governance best practices, covering topic areas such as
organizational models and standards
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
- Delivered the project under the federal procurement micropurchase threshold of $10,000
- Interviewed seven different organizations, including the Government Digital
Service (UK), HM Revenue & Customs (UK), Capital One, and more
- Published the report in the open and with no copyright, making it free to anyone
who wants to learn from and reuse the content
