{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The Veterans Affairs (VA) needs a way to systematically identify and spread the
    adoption of proven clinical and administrative practices across its healthcare
    delivery network. We were brought in to build a knowledge management platform
    in order to achieve this important goal.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    The VA operates the nation's largest healthcare system, called
    the Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA). It consists of 150 medical
    centers and nearly 1,400 community-based outpatient clinics, community
    living centers, Vet centers, and domiciliary. Together these healthcare
    facilities, and the more than 53,000 licensed healthcare practitioners,
    provide comprehensive care to more than 8.3 million veterans each year.
  </p>

  <p>
    When proven healthcare practices emerge in one or more of the VHA's operations,
    how do you systematically identify and spread the adoption of those across the
    VHA's healthcare delivery network? That's the challenge the VA has been facing,
    and an important one to solve given the life-saving implications.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    In collaboration with Agile Six, we've been working with the VHA to address
    this challenge through the delivery of a knowledge management platform called
    the Diffusion Marketplace. The purpose of this platform is to empower VHA
    practitioners and other employees to identify and disseminate promising
    healthcare practices.
  </p>

  <p>
    We've aligned our delivery approach to the <a href="https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-service-handbook/digital-standards">VA's Digital Service Handbook</a>.
    And focused our initial product strategy on figuring out how to design an
    experience that leads to the wider adoption of three life-saving and cost-saving
    practices (for example, rapid naloxone delivery). These practices have already been
    proven to work at small subset of the VHA's healthcare facilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    After our primary design solution is validated, the current plan is to
    scale the number of practices showcased, and to continue to iterate on the
    development of other key features.
