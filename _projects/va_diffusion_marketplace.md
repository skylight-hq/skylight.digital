{% capture summary %}
The Veterans Affairs (VA) needs a way to systematically identify and spread the
adoption of proven clinical and administrative practices across its healthcare
delivery network. We were brought in to build a knowledge management platform
in order to achieve this important goal.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
The VA operates the nation's largest healthcare system, called
the Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA). It consists of 150 medical
centers and nearly 1,400 community-based outpatient clinics, community
living centers, Vet centers, and domiciliary. Together these healthcare
facilities, and the more than 53,000 licensed healthcare practitioners,
provide comprehensive care to more than 8.3 million veterans each year.

When proven healthcare practices emerge in one or more of the VHA's operations,
how do you systematically identify and spread the adoption of those across the
VHA's healthcare delivery network? That's the challenge the VA has been facing,
and an important one to solve given the life-saving implications.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
In collaboration with [Agile Six](https://agile6.com/), we've been
working with the VHA to address this challenge through the delivery of a knowledge management
platform called the Diffusion Marketplace. The purpose of this platform is to empower VHA
practitioners and other employees to identify and disseminate promising healthcare practices.

We've aligned our delivery approach to the [VA's Digital Service Handbook](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-service-handbook/digital-standards).
And focused our initial product strategy on figuring out how to design an
experience that leads to the wider adoption of three life-saving and cost-saving
practices (for example, rapid naloxone delivery). These practices have already been
proven to work at small subset of the VHA's healthcare facilities.

After validating our primary design solution through research and prototyping,
we rapidly iterated toward the release of beta and production versions of the
platform — with an initial collection of over 50 practices.

Following production launch, our team has focused on continually improving the platform,
including:

- Expanding the number of practices, such as hospital-acquired pneumonia prevention,
and the rate at which they're adopted
- Developed a new practice editor feature that empowers practice editors to update
their content directly and helps ensure the site has the most up-to-date information
- Improved the home and search experience to balance the competing needs of targeted
searches with exploratory browsing
{% endcapture %}

{% capture results %}
- Delivered an alpha version of the platform within two months
- Launched a beta version with a small user base in the summer of 2019- i>- - li>- Expanded the number of practices to 119 in total
- Facilitated the adoption of 100 practices through the platform itself
