{% capture summary %}
  <p>
    The Veterans Affairs (VA) wanted to explore options for improving the mobile user
    experience of the new VA.gov. We proposed a mobile product strategy based on a
    combination of our own expertise and extensive research.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture challenge %}
  <p>
    Many organizations are now beginning to deliver mobile experiences through what's
    called a "flagship" mobile app. The purpose of a flagship mobile app is to consolidate
    multiple use cases from multiple user personas into one premiere mobile app.
    In other words, it's either the only or the default mobile app for a brand.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recognizing this trend, the VA realized there might be an opportunity to further
    improve the mobile experience of VA.gov by offering a flagship mobile app. They
    sought guidance on how best to employ a unified, multi-channel, cross-platform
    approach for delivering the most common services used by Veterans.
  </p>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture solution %}
  <p>
    To address this challenge, we augmented on own expertise on mobile app delivery
    with extensive design and technical research. This research process involved:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Performing a comparative analysis of flagship mobile apps across VA-like
      industries to understand the landscape of options available to users, as well as
      common patterns and solutions
    </li>

    <li>
      Conducting a technical teardown of flagship mobile apps across VA-like industries
      to understand the technical approaches used by other organizations when creating
      flagship mobile apps
    </li>

    <li>
      Interviewing several organizations to gain insight into how they've approached
      creating their flagship mobile apps
    </li>

    <li>
      Interviewing Veterans to understand what their mobile experience needs are
    </li>

    <li>
      Identifying the latest trends in mobile app development
    </li>

    <li>
      Analyzing and synthesizing our research data into a comprehensive report
      that detailed our methodology, findings, and recommendations for what the
      VA.gov's mobile product strategy should be going forward
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Our report also provided the VA with a definition of a minimum viable product
    (MVP) for their own flagship mobile app, a decision framework to guide choices
    among mobile app development options (such as mobile web, progressive web application,
    hybrid, cross-platform native, or native), and a flexible mobile architecture approach
    based on pattern we call a "thin client, thick API architecture."

  <ul>
    <li>
      Delivered the project under the federal procurement micropurchase threshold of $10,000
    </li>

    <li>
      Performed a comparative analysis of 17 flagship mobile apps, including Bank of America,
      USAA, Capital One, Mayo Clinic, Zocdoc, FollowMyHealth, and more
    </li>

    <li>
      Defined an MVP roadmap that included nearly 30 key user actions or features
      (e.g., biometric login, prescription refill, and claims status) and which of
      these should be delivered natively or via the mobile web
    </li>

    <li>
      Published the report in the open and with no copyright, making it free to anyone
      who wants to learn from and reuse the content
