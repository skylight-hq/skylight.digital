            Skylight was launched in June of 2017. We're currently made up of 25 people and one ferret.
            A lot of us originally worked for civic-oriented groups such as 18F,
            the U.S. Digital Service, and the Presidential Innovation Fellows.
            Now, as part of Skylight, we're working hard to cultivate an incredible
            team and culture.
          </p>

          <p>
            What brings us together is a passion for creating better outcomes for
            the public through great government digital services. We're basically impact junkies.
            But we're also engineers, developers, designers, product managers, consultants,
            writers, speakers, inventors, roboticists, gamers, authors, veterans,
            entrepreneurs, parents, and more. Such a diverse team always gives us a
            unique perspective on things.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our headquarters is in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chapel+Hill,+NC/@35.9209387,-79.109331,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89acc31c216e7ea7:0x7f03bae00443e4cb!8m2!3d35.9131996!4d-79.0558445">Chapel Hill, North Carolina</a>,
            but we're a distributed and remote-friendly team. A lot of our client work
            originates from Washington DC.

            We're certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) as a <a href="https://www.sba.gov/contracting/government-contracting-programs/hubzone-program">
            Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone)</a> company. This special SBA designation
            means we're committed to revitalizing local communities through job creation.
            In turn, we're granted privileged access to federal government contract opportunities,
            including up to $4M per contract award.
          </p>

          <p>
            To maintain our HUBZone status, 35% of our employees must be located in
            <a href="https://www.sba.gov/contracting/government-contracting-programs/hubzone-program/hubzone-maps">
            one of the nearly 20,000 HUBZone areas across the country</a>. Of that 35%, the greatest
            number of people must be concentrated in our "principal office" location, which is in
            Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The remaining percentage of people are free to live
            in whatever HUBZone locale they prefer.
