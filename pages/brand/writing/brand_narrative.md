## Principles

Our mission is to make government work in a digital world.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
### Why

Every day millions of people — from veterans to immigrants — depend on government services to fulfill their needs. But too often these services are delivered using outmoded policies, practices, and technologies.

### What

We’re public servants at heart who are driven to make government services work better using design and technology.

### How

Thinking and being digital requires fundamental practice, culture, and technology change. And that means institutionalizing modern disciplines such as human-centered design and lean-agile engineering. Everything we offer is designed to accelerate this process of change within government.

## The Skylight difference
{: .mt-6 }

Customers choose to work with us not only because of our talented employees and deep expertise, but also our dedication to serving the public in an open and inclusive manner.

<div class="example" markdown="1">
We’re the **most talented group of digital professionals** within the government contracting industry.

We’re **public servants at heart** who understand and steward the critical missions of government.

We bring a unique blend of **government and commercial know-how** to solving our customer’s biggest digital challenges.

We pursue **modern ways of working**. New trends and technologies are constantly on the horizon. We embrace — even pioneer — new developments, go deep to understand their viability and impact, and harness those with the greatest promise to the benefit of our customers.

We believe in the importance of **capacity building**. Regardless of mission, all government agencies are now technology organizations, which means they need to master disciplines such as human-centered design. Everything about us is designed to help our customers achieve such mastery.

We strive to create a **diverse, equitable, and inclusive** environment for everyone.
