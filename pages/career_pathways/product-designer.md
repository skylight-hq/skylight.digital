Product designers are expected to understand the problem space, identify opportunities, and develop solutions using an iterative approach. Product designers are considered the “Empathizer in Chief.” They’re the primary user advocate and engage in continuous research throughout the product life cycle. As user advocates, product designers create tight feedback loops to make sure the user’s voice is incorporated throughout the decision-making process. They work closely with the product manager (PM) and client to balance business and user needs in order to influence the product vision. Working end-to-end from concept to implementation, product designers conduct research, facilitate design activities, and ensure the product team is building the right thing.
