A product manager (PM) at Skylight is responsible for strategy, planning, execution, stakeholder management, and team health. PMs partner with user researchers, product designers, engineers, client stakeholders, and others to inform their product decisions. A PM must have a clear understanding of users’ needs, the business objectives, and the stakeholders’ vision so they can quickly make feature decisions and determine priority.
