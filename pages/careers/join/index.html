        <h3>Our mission matters</h3>
        <p>
          We’re more than a company. We represent a movement to reinvent how the
          government serves families, patients, veterans, immigrants, and many
          others in today’s digital world. Everything about us — our structure,
          <a href="/company/values/">values</a>,
          <a href="/work/services/">services</a>,
          <a href="/work/experience/">work</a>,
          <a href="/thoughts/blog/">thoughts</a>, and
          <a href="/company/about/">team</a> — is designed with that purpose in
          mind.
        </p>

        <h3>You matter</h3>

          an environment that empowers you to unleash your skills for public
          good, whether that’s improving

          <a href="/work/experience/va-diffusion-marketplace/"
            >helping to save veteran lives</a
          >. You’ll work alongside a team of
          <a href="/company/about/#meet-the-team"
            >extraordinarily-talented people</a
          >
          who strive to bring out the best in you and each other. You’ll also be
          taken care of with a well-thought-out
          <a href="#care-package">compensation and benefits package</a>. We want
          you to be happy, fulfilled, and well-supported.
        </p>

        <h3>We’re just getting started</h3>
        <p>
          We’re still in startup mode, and our future is bright. We’re doing
          impactful work, building an amazing team, and improving every day.

            An internship is short term, generally lasting 2–3 months. An apprenticeship may last for 12 months or more. 
            If you do an internship, there may be an option at the end to extend to an apprenticeship.

          <p>
            We strongly prioritize the human element of the workplace, so the goal of our interview process is to get to know you and how you work. 
            Rather than looking for perfection, we look for qualities like a growth mindset, excellent communication skills, adaptability, and comfort with ambiguity. 
            You won’t be penalized for taking time to think before responding, asking to repeat a question, or correcting yourself. With that in mind, please note:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              All screenings and interviews take place via videoconference.

              Dress in a way that makes you comfortable. No need for blazers or

          We use the interview process not only to evaluate whether you’re a good fit for Skylight 
          but also to determine the most appropriate <a href="/careers/career-pathways/">career level</a>, which will inform your salary range.
        </div>

        <div class="interview-explanation">
          <h3>Interview steps</h3>

          <p>
            After you submit your application, we’ll evaluate your information against the qualifications of the position. 
            If we see a potential match, we’ll initiate the interview process and communicate next steps.
          </p>

          <h4>1. Preliminary screening</h4>
          <p>
            The interview process begins with a 15-minute preliminary screening.
            We’ll send you an email beforehand with background information about
            Skylight. Plan to talk about your skills and experience and what
            you’re passionate about. The call will also cover the interview
            process and basic employment requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Afterward, our hiring team will review notes from the screening, along with your resume and portfolio (if applicable). 
            If it’s a good fit, we’ll move forward with scheduling a skills interview.
          </p>

          <h4>2. Skills interview</h4>
          <p>
            The skills interview typically runs between 60 and 90 minutes (sometimes longer, depending on the role). 
            You’ll typically meet with two interviewers experienced in your discipline, who’ll ask questions about your skills, experience, and how you’d apply them within Skylight's context. 
            We’ll leave 10–15 minutes at the end for your questions.

      <p>
        Prior to the interview, we’ll send you an email with more details to help you prepare. 
        Afterward, your interviewers will share their notes with our hiring team. 
        If the fit seems strong, we’ll schedule a behavioral interview.
      </p>
      
      <div class="interview-explanation">
          <h4>3. Behavioral interview</h4>
          <p>
            The behavioral interview lasts for one hour (sometimes longer, depending on the role). 
            The intent is to assess if you’d be a good fit for Skylight’s values and standards of behavior.
            You’ll typically meet with two interviewers who'll ask questions about how you approach different work situations. 
            We’ll leave 10–15 minutes at the end for your questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s no formal preparation needed for this interview, but we’ll send you an email a few days prior with more details so you know exactly what to expect. 
            If it’s a good fit, you’ll proceed to either an additional interview (if necessary) or a reverse interview.
          </p>
      
          <h4>4. Additional interview (if needed)</h4>
          <p>
            In some cases, we may set up an additional interview to dive deeper into specific aspects of your background or experience. 
            This step may be based on insights from your previous interviews and is designed to give us a thorough understanding of your fit for the role. 
            It’s also a chance for you to meet additional members of the Skylight team and gain more insight into our environment and the position. 
            If it’s a strong fit, we’ll proceed to the reverse interview.
          </p>

          <h4>5. Reverse interview</h4>
          <p>
            The reverse interview is your opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of what it’s like to work at Skylight. 
            During this step, you’ll meet potential future colleagues, giving you the chance to ask questions and learn more about our team, culture, and work style. 
            This is designed to help you decide if Skylight is the right fit for your next career step.

           <p>
            If you’re applying for an internship or apprenticeship, you’ll go through a shorter process. 
          </p>
           <p>
            First, submit your application. If you’re applying for a research or design role, 
            please include a portfolio of 1–2 work samples, if you have one. 
            Your portfolio can be anything from a website to a slide deck (whatever works for you). 
            Please ensure that you either remove the password to your portfolio or provide access details.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you look like a potential match, we’ll do a preliminary screening. 
            Plan to talk about your interests, experiences, and what you hope to get out of an internship or apprenticeship at Skylight. 
          </p>
           <p>
             The next step is a 60-minute skills interview, where you’ll typically meet with one interviewer with experience in your discipline. 
             They’ll ask a variety of questions about your skills and experience, 
             and how you’d apply them within the context of an internship or apprenticeship at Skylight. 
             We’ll leave you with 10–15 minutes at the end for your questions. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, if you’re selected for an internship or apprenticeship, you’ll receive an offer! 
            We’ll decide on a start date, ideally when we're able to onboard a class of interns or apprentices together.
