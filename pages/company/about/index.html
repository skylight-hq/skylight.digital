      <p>
        Skylight was launched in June of 2017. We’re currently made up of 115 people — and one ferret. 
        A lot of us originally worked for civic-oriented groups such as 18F, the U.S. Digital Service, and the Presidential Innovation Fellows. 
        Now, as part of Skylight, we’re working hard to cultivate an incredible team and culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        What brings us together is a passion for creating better outcomes for
        the public through great government digital services. We’re basically impact junkies.
        But we’re also engineers, developers, designers, product managers, consultants,
        writers, speakers, inventors, roboticists, gamers, authors, veterans,
        entrepreneurs, parents, and more. Such a diverse team always gives us a
        unique perspective on things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our official headquarters is in sunny <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3pX7v6YjSmpkwchz5">Sarasota, Florida</a>,
        but we’re a distributed and remote-friendly team currently spread across {{site.state_count}} different states.
        Sometimes the nature of our client work calls for closer proximity to their location.
        So far, we’ve worked with clients located in places like Washington DC, Hartford (Connecticut),
        Montgomery (Alabama), Baltimore (Maryland), and Ottawa (Canada).
