When creating Skylight assets for marketing and communications purposes, we have a few guidelines that we’d like you to follow:

1. Effectively order your content so the audience knows the most important information. Headings use a bold Libre Franklin font.
1. Ensure you’ve included a clear call to action. To add contrast with our primary sans serif font, we use Roboto Mono for certain text elements (e.g., call to action, navigation, pre-headline kicker).
1. White space is important. It allows the audience to focus on key details, visually highlights your content, and adds balance to your design.
1. Images and text should complement each other. The text should be clear, easy to read, and minimal. Images should relate to the topic and help you use fewer words.
