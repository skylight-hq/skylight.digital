        <h3>Our mission matters</h3>
        <p>
          We’re more than a company. We represent a movement to reinvent how the
          government serves families, patients, veterans, immigrants, and many others
          in today’s digital world. Everything about us — our structure,
          <a href="/company/values/">values</a>, <a href="/work/services/">services</a>,
          <a href="/work/experience/">work</a>, <a href="/thoughts/blog/">thoughts</a>,
          and <a href="/company/about/">team</a> — is designed with that purpose in mind.
        </p>

        <h3>You matter</h3>

          for public good, whether that’s improving
          <a href="/work/experience/ct-ece-reporter/">early childhood outcomes</a>
          or <a href="/work/experience/va-diffusion-marketplace/">helping to save veteran lives</a>.
          You’ll work alongside a team of <a href="/company/about/#meet-the-team">extraordinarily-talented people</a>
          who strive to bring out the best in you and each other. You’ll also be taken care of with a
          well-thought-out <a href="#care-package">compensation and benefits package</a>.
          We want you to be happy, fulfilled, and well-supported.
        </p>

        <h3>Interview basics</h3>
        <p>
          We strongly prioritize the human element of the workplace, so the goal of our interview process 
          is to get to know you and how you work. We don’t look for perfection; 
          we look for a growth mindset, excellent communication skills, ability to deal with ambiguity, and capability to adapt. 
          You won’t be penalized for taking time to think before responding, asking to repeat a question, or correcting yourself. 
          With that in mind, please note:
