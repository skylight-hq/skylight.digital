        <p>
          Government services involve a complex mix of components, such as
          policies, operations, people, and technology. For people accessing
          government services, this complexity is often passed onto them. This
          results in disjointed and frustrating experiences, or worse — not
          getting the services they need. For example, how many times have you
          been transferred from one customer support agent to the next, only to
          have to repeat the same information over and over again? This type of
          inefficiency is due to a lack of service design.
        </p>

          alt="Service design components broken down into frontstage and backstage."
        />
        <p>
          Through service design, government organizations can take a more
          holistic, human-centered approach to providing services, including
          both the “frontstage” (what the user sees) and the “backstage” (what
          happens behind the scenes). The result is optimized, end-to-end user
          experiences that deliver greater public value.

            >design-centric organizations consistently achieve high levels of
            performance</a
          >. Clear benefits and tangible results mean organizations across all
          industries, including government, are increasingly investing in
          service design.

          The best way to contract with Skylight for service design support is
          through the federal government’s Small Business Innovation Research
          (SBIR) / Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this program, we were awarded an STTR Phase II contract related to service design.
          The scope of this contract encompassed the full range of activities that go into
          delivering better user experience journeys. These activities include,
          but aren’t limited to, user research, user experience design, product
          management, software delivery, data management, and organizational
          change management.
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as your support requirements “extend or derive” from the
          original scope of work under our STTR Phase II contract, you can
          leverage it to issue a direct (or non-competitive) Phase III award to
          Skylight — without any dollar, time, or size standard restrictions.
