            The USAF Human Systems Division (HSD) mission is to acquire and support human systems to enhance warfighter performance, protection, and survivability. The GearFit program arose after a female fitment event in 2019, where women expressed a desire to provide feedback about their gear.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Limited support for female aviators.</b>
              Much of today's gear was designed using data from the 1960s, when only men were in aviator roles. As a result, female pilots have faced unique issues with their gear. For HSD, providing better fitting gear to women was a top priority that went all the way up to Congress.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Limited pathways for feedback.</b>
              Without a formal system for collecting and analyzing feedback from the field, feedback was disjointed and valuable insights were often missed. Also, the Air Force’s historical culture of “grin and bear it” suppressed the free flow of gear feedback.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Aviators are busy.</b>
              Aircrew are constantly moving and focused on the mission, leaving little time for computer work. Even in uncomfortable or imperfect gear, they find ways to carry on. This makes it difficult to recall feedback on the spot.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row text">

          <h3 class="callout-heading">Solutions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Targeting female aircrew.</b>
              After initially launching to 100+ female fighter pilots, GearFit opened to 3,500+ aircrew across 10 MAJCOMs to address the limited gear support for female aviators. Many female GearFit users have expressed gratitude to the Air Force for listening to their concerns and providing an avenue to submit feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>New feedback pathways.</b>
              After gear data and feedback is collected, we built a subject matter expert (SME) feedback-response workflow with an anonymous mode for submissions. The GearFit team also produced 75 pages of content on common gear solutions and information in order to arm aircrew and gear technicians with comprehensive knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Clear and simple submit flow.</b>
              GearFit's design is simple, accessible, and straight to the point. When aircrew have feedback, they select the gear they use and describe the problem in just a few clicks. GearFit can sort and display gear based on the impact it has on aircrew, making it easy for leaders to understand at a glance which gear needs attention the most.

            After receiving

            <b>50+ gear improvement opportunities</b>
            — including procurement actions, gear requirement changes, safety updates, and technician training — and collected innovative suggestions for improving gear throughout the acquisition life cycle.
