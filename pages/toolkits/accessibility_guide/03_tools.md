# Tools

## Color tools

- [WebAIM color contrast checker](http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) compares two hex colors and tells you whether they meet WCAG AA and AAA contrast thresholds
- [Snook's color contrast analyzer](http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html) lets you adjust RGB and HSV values and reports contrast compliance interactively
- [NC State palette accessibility evaluator](http://accessibility.oit.ncsu.edu/tools/color-contrast/) lets you compare contrast between three or more colors for WCAG AA or AAA compliance
- [Color Safe](http://colorsafe.co/) is a guide for choosing colors that meet WCAG contrast thresholds
- [Color Contrast Analyzer](http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/) is a desktop application for contrast checking that also simulates different forms of color impairment

### Color impairment

- [Color Oracle](http://colororacle.org/) is another desktop application for simulating color impairment on your entire screen
- [colourblind](https://github.com/Altreus/colourblind) is another simulation tool similar to Daltonize, but with more options (protanopia, protanomaly, deuteranopia, deuteranomaly, tritanopia, tritanomaly, achromatopsia, and achromatomaly) in a single bookmarklet
- [postcss-colorblind](https://github.com/btholt/postcss-colorblind) is a CSS build tool that modifies colors in your CSS to simulate [four common impairment groups](https://github.com/skratchdot/color-blind#color-blindness-table)

## Accessibility review tools

These tools can be used to test sites for Section 508 and WCAG compliance in browser:

- [achecker](http://achecker.ca/) is an accessibility reporter for HTML only
- [Google's Accessibility Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb?hl=en) is a Chrome plugin for running basic accessibility tests from the comfort of your browser
- [Web Accessibility Toolbar (WAT)](https://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/wat/) is an IE tool that's been developed to aid manual examination of web pages for a variety of aspects of accessibility, and is used by [DHS' Trusted Tester program](https://www.dhs.gov/trusted-tester)
- [WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/) is an accessibility auditor and browser extension with document inspection features
- The [W3C](http://www.w3.org/) maintains a comprehensive [list of web accessibility evaluation tools](http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/)

## Autocomplete widgets

These JavaScript widgets produce HTML with ARIA autocomplete attributes:

- [Awesomplete](http://leaverou.github.io/awesomplete/) is dependency-free
- [Select2](https://select2.github.io/) also requires jQuery

## Automated testing

Automated testing tools can help you find some of the more common accessibility mistakes quickly. However, no automated tool can detect all accessibility issues. [A recent experiment by the U.K.'s Government Digital Service](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/24/what-we-found-when-we-tested-tools-on-the-worlds-least-accessible-webpage/) found that the best automated tools only caught about 40 percent of the errors on a test site; some of the most popular tools caught less than 20 percent. Whatever automated tool you use, be sure to also do manual testing. These tools can be used in automated tests and with continuous integration
tools to help you ensure that your sites remain accessible throughout the development process:

- [a11y](https://github.com/addyosmani/a11y) is a Node-based accessibility auditing with both command-line and JavaScript APIs
- [AccessLintCI](https://github.com/accesslint/accesslint-ci) runs accessibility tests in CircleCI builds and comments on GitHub pull requests with new accessibility issues
- [pa11y](http://pa11y.org/) is like a11y, but consists of a larger suite of tools, including command-line and JavaScript APIs, a [web service](https://github.com/nature/pa11y-webservice), and a [dashboard](https://github.com/nature/pa11y-dashboard) for monitoring accessibility reports across multiple sites
- [ra11y](https://github.com/benbalter/ra11y) is a Ruby-based accessibility testing tool tuned for use with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and static sites
- [webalin](http://webalin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is a Python-based 508 compliance linter for HTML

There are many other [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages tagged [wcag](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=wcag) and [a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=a11y).
