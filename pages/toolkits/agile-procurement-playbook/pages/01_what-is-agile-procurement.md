# What is agile procurement?

Agile procurement is a procurement strategy that focuses on issuing
contracts quickly as well as de-risking the overall product by ensuring
that only the required services/features are being built in rapid
iterations for the correct users.

As contracts increase in scope and size, the ability to quickly award
those contracts diminishes greatly. Likewise, the smaller the scope of a
contract, the faster it can be awarded. An agile procurement strategy
favors breaking up large monolithic contracts into smaller, well-defined
components called modules. The modules are pieces of work that are
required for the product’s success, such as:

-   Conducting user research to ensure the right services are being
    built,
-   Designing to ensure that the end user is at the center of all
    development, and
-   Engineering to build out any services that might be required.

When an agency is starting a new initiative or modernizing an existing
system, it’s expected and normal to be unsure about the ideal order for
awarding all of the module contracts. There are typically a few known
tasks that will be required (e.g. starting to build out a basic cloud
infrastructure, interviewing prospective users of the product, etc.)
that can be the first sets of modular contracts awarded. While that work
is underway, the agency stakeholders can build and maintain a product
roadmap for the rest of the contracts needed to complete the product.
