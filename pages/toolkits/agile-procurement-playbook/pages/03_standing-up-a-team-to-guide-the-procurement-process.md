Standing up a team to guide the procurement process
---------------------------------------------------

As mentioned earlier, a cross-functional team is needed to get the most
out of an agile procurement strategy. The following roles are needed.

### Leadership

Adjusting to new procurement strategies requires leadership support and
buy-in. Leadership will need to actively support the procurement team as
they:

-   Try out flexible and creative approaches and solutions to
    procurement and contracting,

-   Work across traditional government silos, and

-   Potentially ruffle some feathers as the product team introduces new
    ways of building products and services.

### Building a cross-functional procurement team

The ideal procurement team is both lean and multi-disciplinary. To
increase your chances of success, you’ll want to include the roles we
describe below.

#### Product owner

The product owner is [*responsible and
accountable*](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play6) for the overall success
of the product. This person usually runs the day-to-day project work and
sets priorities based on stakeholder feedback.

While some positions on the team may be outsourced, the product owner
must be a government employee.

#### Procurement specialist

This team member is an expert in your agency’s contracting methods. They
work closely with the other members of the team to understand the
product’s objectives, goals, and needs, and to optimize procurements
accordingly.

#### User researcher

A user researcher will help the team identify, understand, and
prioritize the knowledge gaps that you’ll need to fill. With all
products, there are:

-   Known knowns,

-   Known unknowns, and, most dangerously,

-   Unknown unknowns.

If a product is large, there are going to be gaps of understanding in
areas of design, development, and user research. The user researcher
will work with the product owner to define the initial steps to
incorporate into procurement requirements.

#### Engineer

Chances are, you’re using agile procurement to build a digital service —
an informational website, an online service that users will interact
with, or internal systems/tools to support the agency’s mission.

The engineer lead will work with the product owner to lay out the
fundamental building blocks needed to support the product. They will
identify the skill sets needed for the first round of procurements, such
as experts in cloud infrastructure, databases, or APIs.

### Working together: building an agile culture

One of the core tenets of an agile culture is that it requires teams to
be highly collaborative. This can be a significant change in the way
that agencies currently execute projects. For larger organizations, it’s
common to see a functional or matrixed structure. While it makes sense
at the organization’s top level to organize itself in this way, it
increases risk when building a specific product or service.

Agency departments that are traditionally siloed from other departments
will need to cross-collaborate. Terminology can help shift mindsets and
habits. Instead of referring to agency departments (OIT, Procurement,
etc.), agile culture suggests that agencies think in terms of product
teams. The product team should consist of all of the disciplines
required to deliver the product.

A one-team, one-dream mentality is necessary even across the different 
vendors that support a product’s development. The government will be 
responsible for managing these vendor relationships, and it will be 
in their best interest to treat every vendor supporting the product as 
if they were on a single team.

The importance of creating cross-functional teams can’t be overstated.
The overall success of the product will depend on how well the team is
able to function. Leadership can support effective collaboration by
investing in the tools and workspaces that help team members come
together.
