# Appendix D: TEP rating system examples

The Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP) and contracting experts have wide latitude in determining how they're going to be evaluating proposals. Picking a system in which rating will be made is important in how the overall selection is going to be made.

## Confidence factors

A confidence rating system reflects the Government's confidence on whether a vendor will be able to successfully build the product based on the proposal submitted.

- **High confidence:** The Government has ***high confidence*** that the Offeror understands the requirement, proposes a sound approach, and will be successful in performing the contract with ***little or no*** Government intervention.
- **Some confidence:** The Government has ***some confidence*** that the Offeror understands the requirement, proposes a sound approach, and will be successful in performing the contract with ***some*** Government intervention.
- **Low confidence:** The Government has ***low confidence*** that the Offeror understands the requirement, proposes a sound approach, or will be successful in performing the contract ***even with*** Government intervention.

## Adjectival ratings

An adjectival rating system for scoring will be used and the technical panel will determine final scoring, based on a consensus. The following is the adjectival rating system that will be used to evaluate proposals:

- **Exceptional:** Greatly exceeds all minimum requirements of the criteria; has a high probability of success; contains no weaknesses or deficiencies.
- **Good:** Exceeds all the minimum requirements of the criteria; has an above average probability of success; contains no significant weaknesses and only minor, correctable weaknesses exist.
- **Acceptable:** Meets all the minimum requirements of the criteria; has an average probability of success; any weaknesses can readily be corrected; no deficiencies exist.
- **Unacceptable:** Fails to meet the minimum requirements of the criteria; contains multiple significant weaknesses or one or more.
