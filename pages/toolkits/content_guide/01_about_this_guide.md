# About this guide

This is our company content style guide. It helps us write clear and consistent content across teams and channels. Please use it as a reference when you’re writing for Skylight. We hope that by using this guide, you learn how we talk to clients and partners, express ourselves online, and communicate about our work. This guide is here when you’re wondering whether to capitalize the word agile, for instance, or when you’re wondering how to create a friendly, informational tone.

This guide goes beyond basic grammar and style points. To that end, we’ve structured it into descriptively named sections. Find the topic you’re looking for in our table of contents. We aren’t opposed if you’d like to read it from start to finish, of course.

## If you work at another organization

We encourage you to make a copy of this guide and adapt it to your organizational needs. If a certain section isn’t relevant to you and your team, delete it. And if you feel the guide is missing a section, by all means, add it. This guide is yours to use, and we trust you’ll update it in the ways that best suit you. All we ask is that you credit Skylight.
