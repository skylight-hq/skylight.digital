# About this guide

This is our company content style guide. It helps us write clear and consistent content across teams and channels. Please use it as a reference when you’re writing for Skylight. We hope that by using this guide, you learn how we talk to clients and partners, express ourselves online, and communicate about our work. This guide is here when you’re wondering whether to capitalize the word agile, for instance, or when you’re wondering how to create a friendly, informational tone.

This guide goes beyond basic grammar and style points. To that end, we’ve structured it into descriptively named sections. Find the topic you’re looking for in our table of contents, or search by keyword. We aren’t opposed if you’d like to read it from start to finish, of course.
