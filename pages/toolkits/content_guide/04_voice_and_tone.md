# Voice and tone

## Skylight’s voice

Our voice has five key qualities communicated in both what we say and how we say it. Working together, these qualities make everything we write sound uniquely Skylight.

* **Expressive.** We use simple words and phrases to convey profound thoughts and big feelings.
* **Smart.** We bring unique knowledge and insights to the conversation.
* **Lighthearted.** The world is tough. The work we do is tough. We don't take ourselves too seriously, and we're easy to work with.
* **Embracing.** Whoever you are, we're your biggest supporter.
* **Worldly.** We’re interested, knowledgeable, and always learning. We have a broad worldview, but we’re not know-it-alls.

## Skylight’s tone

While our voice is constant, our tone should change depending on the emotional state of the person we’re addressing. We wouldn’t want to use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as we would with someone who’s laughing. In other words, we choose our tone based on empathy and context.

The way we speak encourages people to tell us more, and it invites people to get to know us. Because of this, we take a conversational tone with our writing: everyday talk that’s easy to understand and feels approachable.

## How to become great at voice and tone

One of our company values is remembering whom we serve. By keeping users and partners in mind, you allow yourself to see someone else’s perspective, helping you feel empathy for them. Trust what you observe. Then put the good things you notice into practice.
