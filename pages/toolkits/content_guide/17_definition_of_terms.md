# Definition of terms

At Skylight, we use a number of specialized terms to describe our way of working. Refer to the below definitions whenever you come upon a term or phrase that’s new to you, but commonly used within Skylight.

* **Business development lead:** individual(s) responsible for developing and executing Skylight’s overall strategy for winning new business.
* **Capture:** an industry term describing the efforts that precede a formal proposal submission. The broad goal of a “capture” effort is to develop a strategy that puts Skylight in the best possible position to win new work with a customer.
* **Contributor:** broad term for anyone who participates in the creation of content for a proposal response or otherwise participates in the development or review of proposal content. Content types can vary (e.g., narrative, presentation materials, illustrations).
* **Contract:**  a legally-binding agreement between Skylight and a customer detailing the exact work to be accomplished and other relevant terms (e.g., period of performance, financials, legal terms).
* **People manager:** refers to an executive, manager, or team lead. Currently, there aren’t any line managers at Skylight beyond the executive team. There are team leads, such as those who serve as engagement managers over our contracts.
* **Team lead:** refers to someone serving in a leadership/management capacity who’s closest to your work and therefore most familiar with your performance.
