# Introduction

In this playbook, we lay out strategies that will help government agencies share data safely, securely, and ethically. The strategies are focused on interagency data sharing, although many practices will also benefit sharing data with the public.

## How to use this playbook

We recommend that agencies who own data read the following sections in order to build a data-sharing framework that respects the laws and regulations that apply to their data:

- [Enabling data sharing](/work/toolkits/data-sharing-playbook/enabling-data-sharing/)
- [Safeguarding data](/work/toolkits/data-sharing-playbook/safeguarding-data/)
- [Responding to data requests](/work/toolkits/data-sharing-playbook/responding-to-data-requests/)

Agencies that seek to request data will benefit from the following sections to initiate strong data sharing partnerships:

 - [Preparing a successful data request](/work/toolkits/data-sharing-playbook/preparing-a-successful-data-request/)
 - [Identify the type of legal data sharing agreement you'll need](/work/toolkits/data-sharing-playbook/responding-to-data-requests#identify-the-type-of-legal-data-sharing-agreement-you-will-need/)

Finally, we recommend that all agencies read the guidance on [transferring data](/work/toolkits/data-sharing-playbook/transferring-data/) before transferring data to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of the data being shared.
