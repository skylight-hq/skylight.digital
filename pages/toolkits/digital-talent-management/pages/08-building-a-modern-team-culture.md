Building a modern team culture
==============================

*“Culture eats strategy for breakfast.”* [^6]

Building the right organizational culture is the most important thing
you can do. The right organizational culture:

-   Guides everyday interactions between the people on your team
-   Creates an environment where people are happy to come to work
-   Helps with recruiting and retention
-   Increases team performance because everyone is aligned around common
    goals and values
-   Creates an inclusive environment
-   Determines how leadership and teams react to failures and setbacks

Culture is built and sustained intentionally. Don’t expect to
organically grow into the culture you want.

Understand the connection between culture and performance
---------------------------------------------------------

The 2014 State of DevOps Report[^7] did the research to identify a
predictive link between organizational culture and performance. The
cultural practices and norms that characterize high trust organizations
— good information flow, cross functional collaboration, shared
responsibilities, learning from failures, and encouragement of new ideas
— correlate strongly with high performance.^6^

Westrum provides a useful typology that contrasts the qualities of three
different types of organizational culture:

Pathological                    | Bureaucratic                | Generative
------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------
Power oriented                  | Rule oriented               | Performance oriented
Low cooperation                 | Modest cooperation          | High cooperation
Messengers shot                 | Messengers neglected        | Messengers trained
Responsibilities shirked        | Narrow responsibilities     | Risks are shared
Bridging discouraged            | Bridging tolerated          | Bridging encouraged
Failure leads to scapegoating   | Failure leads to justice    | Failure leads to inquiry
Novelty crushed                 | Novelty leads to problems   | Novelty implemented
{: .table}

Most traditional government organizations tend to be bureaucratic.
However, digital teams thrive in generative cultures, which allow for
innovation and experimentation.

Strive for a generative culture
-------------------------------

[*re:Work from
Google*](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/identify-dynamics-of-effective-teams/)
identifies five characteristics of effective teams, and these all
support a generative organizational culture:

1.  **Psychological safety** — team members feel safe to take risks and
    be vulnerable in front of each other
2.  **Dependability** — team members get things done on time and meet
    the high bar for excellence
3.  **Structure and clarity** — team members have clear roles, plans,
    and goals
4.  **Meaning** — work is personally important to team members
5.  **Impact** — team members think their work matters and creates
    change

Next, we’ll break down the basics of encouraging these cultural
characteristics.

### Psychological safety

While all aspects of culture start at the top, creating a
psychologically safe environment is something only leadership can do.
Here are some of the key actions for building psychological safety.

**Demonstrate willingness to try-fail-learn.** The best signal
leadership can send to encourage experimentation is taking failures in
stride. Provide executive air cover for experiments and new ideas. Be
prepared to defend the actions of your team to others in your
organization. Don’t assign blame. Instead, encourage teams to learn from
failures. Understand that not all innovation leads to success. If
necessary, work with teams to design smaller experiments with reduced
impact.

**Require blameless retrospectives.** Empower teams to make changes in
how they work. It’s important to act on all follow-ups from
retrospectives. Through action, you’ll show that learning from
retrospectives is important to you.

-   [*How to run an agile
    retrospective*](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective)

**During meetings and workshops, encourage all voices to be heard.**
Work through how you might implement a suggestion, rather than rejecting
it immediately. Discourage interruptions. Create multiple avenues for
people to contribute. For example, some people may not feel comfortable
speaking up, but might be happy to write some thoughts down on a
post-it.

**Create opportunities for feedback.** Regularly ask for feedback
through employee surveys. Ask for feedback on organizational initiatives
and on leadership. Act on the feedback you receive. Your employees will
participate when they see that their opinions have value and result in
change. Create mechanisms for anonymous feedback as well. Not everyone
is going to feel comfortable being candid with feedback.

### Dependability

Dependability is an individual trait. As a team member, you have to
personally be dependable. As a leader, you have to support and encourage
dependable behavior.

**Encourage employees to be accountable and responsible for their
actions.** Team members shouldn’t need to fear criticism or censure when
they own their actions. Create an environment where team members are
supported when they accept responsibility for their actions.

**Help the team manage commitments.** As a leader, your job is to ensure
that external deadlines are realistic. Teams that are strapped for time
will miss deadlines and produce low-quality work. Planning should always
take into account the velocity of the team and respect work-life
boundaries.

**Remove blockers and distractions.** To help team members get things
done on time, remove any blockers they encounter. Constantly pave the
way for a team to be productive. Attend standup meetings to understand
daily blockers. Similarly, remove distractions in the workplace.
Eliminate distractions such as noise and unnecessary meetings.

**Be clear about expectations.** Be clear about your expectations of
employees. Specify and document expectations around accountability,
ownership, and dependability. This should include expectations around
technical excellence. Everyone on your team should understand the
quality of work they are expected to produce and how that quality will
be measured.

### Structure and clarity

**Clarify and document roles.** Each team member should understand their
role in the organization and on their team. Document the definition and
boundaries for each role. In smaller teams, everyone does everything. As
your teams grow, role definitions will provide structure and clarity.

**Help set and achieve goals.** Personal growth is important for
employee retention. People will stay in their jobs if they know that
they are learning and growing. Help each team member set goals for what
they personally want to achieve. Then do your best to create
opportunities for people to meet their goals.

Teams should also collectively set goals and support each other to
achieve them. The [*Objectives and Key
Results*](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/)
(OKRs) framework from Google works well to set goals and track progress
at multiple levels in your organization. OKRs help align individual and
team goals with organization goals. Each goal should have an associated
plan on how to achieve it.

-   [*How we use OKRs on GOV.UK, the UK government
    website*](https://visitmy.website/2019/02/21/how-we-use-okrs-gov-uk/)

### Meaning and impact

**Remind people of the mission.** Have a clear and concise mission, and
include vision and values statements on posters in your physical space.
The constant reminder is important so that teams don’t forget the larger
picture.

-   [*Our values: a series of posters from the
    USDS*](https://medium.com/the-u-s-digital-service/our-values-1fc02b53598)
-   [*Posters from UK’s GDS*](https://govdesign.tumblr.com/)
-   [*A set of posters emphasizing 18F’s principles and
    values*](https://github.com/18F/18f-posters)

**Build with shared empathy.** To understand the potential impact of
their work, encourage everyone on the team to participate in Discovery.
By interacting with users, the team will understand the problem they are
trying to solve and the impact that problem has on everyday lives.

**See the impact of the work.** Have everyone on the team participate in
usability tests to observe how their solution makes things easier for
users. Write frequently about the impact of the work that you are doing.
This storytelling is important, both within the team and across your
organization.

**Assign people to projects they are passionate about.** Team members
who are passionate about a particular topic will be excited about the
work they do — and be more productive. When you can, give people a
choice by asking them which projects they care about and would like to
work on.

Create a welcoming and inclusive environment
--------------------------------------------

A welcoming and inclusive culture empowers people to provide outstanding
public service.

### Create and enforce a Code of Conduct

A Code of Conduct puts into writing how you expect people to behave in
the workplace and at work events. It codifies your commitment to an
inclusive environment. Create a documented process for enforcing the
Code of Conduct and an anonymous process for reporting violations of the
Code.

-   18F has a [*Code of
    Conduct*](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
    that you can adopt and modify as necessary

### Empower people to speak up

Create a community where everyone feels empowered to speak up. It’s
useful to do this in a town hall setting, as well as in 1-on-1's. Create
office hours for people to drop in and chat about anything. And create
an anonymous feedback forum so that those who are uncomfortable bringing
up issues in person can do so anonymously.

### Use inclusive language in all communications

“*As we build government services, we want to ensure they are accessible
and welcoming to everyone who needs to use them. Inclusive language
helps to be more accurate and build trust with our users*.” [^8]

Use inclusive language in all communications with your organization and
the services you build. These resources can help:

-   This [*inclusive content guide from
    18F*](https://content-guide.18f.gov/inclusive-language/) is short
    and easy to internalize for all communications.
-   The Ontario Digital Service has a useful [*inclusive design toolkit
    available
    online*](https://www.ontario.ca/page/inclusive-design-toolkit).

### Provide training on unconscious bias

Unconscious bias is “learned stereotypes that are automatic,
unintentional, deeply ingrained, and able to influence behavior.” [^9] 
Everyone has these biases.

Unconscious bias training helps create awareness for this ingrained
bias. Have everyone on your team attend unconscious bias training. This
will help improve everyday interactions. It will also help during the
interview process as you attempt to build a diverse team.

-   Australia’s Queensland government has a [*great set of resources on
    unconscious bias
    training*](https://www.forgov.qld.gov.au/unconscious-biases)

### Case study: Ontario Digital Service

Direct communication lines between staff and leadership help empower staff to create change in their workplace. Hilary Hartley, Chief Digital Officer of the Ontario Digital Service, knows this from her time as a founding member of 18F. 18F’s [*Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion*](https://handbook.18f.gov/diversity/) policy is a model for any level of government.

Ontario Digital Service adopted these principles into the People Board, a group whose mission is to make work better. They engage employees to create change in the office, support diversity and inclusion initiatives, and represent employee voices to senior management.[^10] A representative from the People Board sits on the Senior Management Table to advocate for employees. This representative is elected by peers based on their capacity to represent staff voices and perspectives.

People Board members meet every two weeks for the six months of their term and can only serve two consecutive terms to ensure other staff get an opportunity to participate.

Employees know that the People Board represents them fairly, and as a result, elected members are trusted advocates. They create a feedback loop between employees and management that motivates employees to change their workplace.
