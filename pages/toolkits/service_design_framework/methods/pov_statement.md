## Who's involved
Team members and stakeholders from the organization who can contribute to brainstorming

## Timeframe
After you've completed initial research and have created artifacts, and before you begin brainstorming ideas prioritizing the ideas you want to explore; plan to spend about 30 minutes

## How to do this method

Gather your team, using the template provided, and follow these steps:

### 1. Gather data

Using the existing research, collect ideas for each of these categories:

* User: Who you’re designing solutions for
* Need: What are they trying to accomplish with a service
* Insight: Why your users need to meet this need

Consult artifacts such as [affinity maps][(#affinity-mapping)](https://app.mural.co/t/skylight2171/m/skylight2171/1628006566360/e588c37188c7f835926d7a41315f9e36847465e1?sender=ubabac35f4785db237eae9972), [personas](https://app.mural.co/t/skylight2171/m/skylight2171/1626192437600/a517a9bcb2268baad6dd19e950dd50b19df03a22?sender=ubabac35f4785db237eae9972), and [customer journey maps](https://app.mural.co/t/skylight2171/m/skylight2171/1627402102755/065817673e641f9494c278f59b5ef2a02aec5d32?sender=ubabac35f4785db237eae9972) to inform your ideas.

### 2. Fill in the template

Decide on one idea for each category — user, need, and insight — and combine them into a statement using the fill-in-the-blank style template.

### 3. Refine the statement

Try writing down the whole statement outside the template to revisit. Does it:

* Have a narrow enough focus to help guide solution ideas?
* Avoid prescribing a solution?
* Allow for multiple solution possibilities?
* Look concise and sound good?
