# POV (point of view) statement
{: .mt-0 }

Articulate who your customers are, their needs, and important insights about them. Use this statement to gain a deeper understanding of the problem space and start developing solutions.

<div class="callout--tip callout--summary" markdown="1">
## Templates
[POV statement]({{ site.data.service_design_templates.service_blueprint.url }}) <span class="badge badge-sub">Mural</span>

## Who's involved
Team members and stakeholders from the organization who can contribute to brainstorming

## Timeframe
After you've completed initial research and have created artifacts, and before you begin brainstorming ideas prioritizing the ideas you want to explore; plan to spend about 30 minutes
</div>

## How to do this method

Gather your team, using the template provided, and follow these steps:

### 1. Gather data

Using the existing research, collect ideas for each of these categories:

* User: Who you’re designing solutions for
* Need: What are they trying to accomplish with a service
* Insight: Why your users need to meet this need

Consult artifacts such as [affinity maps][(#affinity-mapping)]({{ site.data.service_design_templates.affinity_map.url }}), [personas]({{ site.data.service_design_templates.proto_personas.url }}), and [customer journey maps]({{ site.data.service_design_templates.customer_journey_map.url }}) to inform your ideas.

### 2. Fill in the template

Decide on one idea for each category — user, need, and insight — and combine them into a statement using the fill-in-the-blank style template.

### 3. Refine the statement

Try writing down the whole statement outside the template to revisit. Does it:

* Have a narrow enough focus to help guide solution ideas?
* Avoid prescribing a solution?
* Allow for multiple solution possibilities?
* Look concise and sound good?
