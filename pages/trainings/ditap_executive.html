            The U.S. Digital Service and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy
            launched the DITAP program in order to increase the development of
            digital acquisition experts across government. By 2022, all federal
            acquisition professionals managing contracts of $7M or more will

          <p>
            To achieve mission success in today’s digital world, agencies must
            master the art of digital acquisition. Leaders arguably play the most
            important role in making this transition happen, but need to manage
            their time carefully. We’ve taken the core elements from our longer,
            6-month DITAP course and distilled it into an executive-level,
            crash-course summary — perfect for those who need a learning
            experience that gets right to the point.
          </p>

          <p>
            This course is designed primarily for agency leaders and executives
            who need a "Cliff Notes" version of our longer, more in-depth DITAP
            course. But that's not to say this course is only for executives.
            Anyone who plays a role in the lifecycle of an acquisition (for example,
            finance officer, legal counsellor, procurement officer, program
            manager, or technical manager) and needs a crash-course tour of modern
            digital acquisition will benefit greatly from this training.

          <p>
            None! Any amount of familiarity with modern practices and technologies
            will be helpful, but this course is designed to give you an
            introduction to the fundamentals of modern digital acquisition. As
            such, we don’t assume you come in with any more knowledge than maybe
            hearing the word "agile" a couple times.

            Our default method of administering this course is remote. After you
            register, you’ll be given a Zoom weblink to join the meeting. We
            recommend that you download the Zoom web-based application prior to
            joining class.

            Remote course delivery isn’t the only option, however. While we’ve
            designed the course to be virtual so that anyone, anywhere can sign up
            to learn about digital acquisition, we love to administer in-person
            training, too. If you’d like to schedule an in-person training for

            Each course requires a minimum of 15 participants. The run dates are
