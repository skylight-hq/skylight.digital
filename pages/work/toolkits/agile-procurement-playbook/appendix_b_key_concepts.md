# Appendix B: Key concepts

## Brief introduction to agile software development

Agile is a time-bound, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver all at once. There's typically a cadence called sprints in which the team commits to delivering artifacts at the end of each for review. These artifacts can be working software, user personas, wireframes, etc.

By taking this approach of delivering working software at the end of each sprint, progress can be closely monitored and course corrected throughout the lifetime of the product. This iterative approach to product and software development focuses on de-risking the ultimate delivery of product. This approach will require more involvement from key stakeholders to ensure that the product is on track towards delivery.
