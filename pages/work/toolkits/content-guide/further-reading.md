# Further reading

We adapted this guide from [Mailchimp](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design) and [18F](https://content-guide.18f.gov/), and we’d like to thank their content teams for championing plain language and information accessibility. We generally follow [AP style](https://www.apstylebook.com/) unless otherwise noted.
