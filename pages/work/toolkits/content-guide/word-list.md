# Word list

Below are rules for how we use common words and phrases. The bold term shows the accepted form (capitalization, hyphenation, punctuation), with accompanying text explaining usage.

If you don’t see a word here and aren’t sure what to do, check [AP style](https://www.apstylebook.com/).
{: .callout--note }

## A

**ages,** avoid hyphens in ages unless it clarifies the text. For example, “a group of 10 18-year-old White House tourists.”

**agile,** don’t capitalize agile, unless it's the first word of a sentence.

**am,** not a.m.

**aka** (also known as), not a.k.a.

## B

**back end,** when used as a noun.

**back-end,** when used as an adjective. For example, “back-end development.”

**bid & proposal,** when singular and **bids & proposals** when plural. It’s not bid & proposals when in the plural form.

## C

**civic tech,** not civictech or CivicTech

**Congress** refers to the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.

**congressional** is lowercase unless part of a proper name. For example, “Congressional Record.”

**current year** is lowercase. It’s okay to abbreviate as CY on the second reference.

**decision-maker/decision-making**

**Defense Services (DS)**

**DE&I,** not DEI

**DevOps**

**digital coalition**

**Drive** when referring to a Google Drive.

**drop down** when used as a noun. For example, “an option from the drop down.” Never dropdown.

**drop-down** when used as an adjective. For example, “drop-down menu.”

**email,** not e-mail

**executive branch**

**Executive Office (EO)**

**e.g.,** abbreviation for “exempli gratia.” If using, don’t end the sentence with “etc.”

**etc.,** abbreviation for etcetera. Don’t use it redundantly. If you are starting a list with “for example,” you don’t need to add etc. to the end of the sentence.

**ex.** abbreviation for “example.” If using, don’t end the sentence with “etc.”

## F

**federal,** unless part of a proper noun. For example, “Federal Bureau of Investigation.”

**Human Services (HS)**

## I

**info** is an acceptable shortening of information. In formal situations, use the full word.
