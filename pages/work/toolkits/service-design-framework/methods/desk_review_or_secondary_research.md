## How to use this method

By researching existing data around your topic, you develop a baseline understanding of your project’s context. Data can include both qualitative and quantitative information, and generally fall into two main categories:

* **Internal:** Documents created and used by the organization, including metrics, documentation related to the service, or anything else related to the project
* **External:** Articles or reports related to the problem space

To stay organized and make the most of this research, follow these steps:

### 1. Define your topic

Start with a research question or area of interest.

### 2. Search

For internal resources, request documents related to that topic or search for them within the organization. For external resources, try to use a research database such as Google Scholar. If you use Google or another regular search engine — or even if you use a research database — make sure to evaluate the reliability of the resources you find. Is a report peer reviewed? Does the author of an article work at a reputable institution?

### 3. Review

As systematically as possible, review each of the collected documents. Add them to your [catalog of documents]({{ site.data.service_design_templates.catalog_of_documents.url }}), quickly summarizing their relevance to the project or quick insights gained from them.

### 4. Share

Share valuable learnings with team members, socializing the catalog of documents and pointing out resources people should read in full.
