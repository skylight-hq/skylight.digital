# Stakeholder mapping
{: .mt-0 }

Create a visual representation of all the people who can influence a project and how they’re connected. This can help you involve and get buy-in from the right people during the service design process.

## How to use this method

With your core team and the template provided, follow these steps:

### 1. Brainstorm

As a team, identify all potential stakeholders of your project — one per virtual or paper sticky note. These could be staff members, organizational units, or any other people who have a stake in or will be impacted by the project’s success. Try to be as granular and as comprehensive as possible.

### 2. Group ideas

Start to pull out patterns among the stakeholders you’ve identified. Group people who belong in the same category, then decide on a name for that category (for example, “organization leadership”).

### 3. Map relationships

With your project in the center, define the relationships between the stakeholders around it. Get more granular as you get farther from the center.

### 4. Prioritize

To define how you’ll collaborate and communicate with stakeholders moving forward, use the prioritization matrix. Mapping according to power and interest, you’ll get a sense of who to engage on a spectrum from low to high touch.
